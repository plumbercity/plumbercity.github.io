<p>Water that has actually been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been gotten rid of-- destructive. For this factor, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this kind of deterioration A softener is merely catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (generally salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
<p>However is a plumbing catastrophe impending or simply an issue for the long run? Replacing old pipes in a 1,500 square foot, two-bathroom house expenses $4,000 to $10,000, and requires cutting open walls and floorings, so you certainly do not wish to do the job before it's required.
