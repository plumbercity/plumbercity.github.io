<p>Stegle says that when they are working with a client on a custom-made home, they will work straight with the property owner when it comes to selecting faucets and other components. As a subcontractor, those choices might have already been made.

<p>The issue of leak can be attributed to any variety of factors which can range from the tank is old and broken, to over-pressurization, along with bad maintenance.

If the tank is old and broken, the force exerted by the growth occurring when boiling the water causes the reservoir to break and begin leaking. The treatment for this is to replace the water heater unit.</p>
