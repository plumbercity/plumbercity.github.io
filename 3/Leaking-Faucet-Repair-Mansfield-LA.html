<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capability and can't bring in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank can be found in. An on-board computer determines the amount of water that flows through the softener. Regrowth immediately begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and family of 4, regrowth usually takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>A water softener is made up of a mineral tank and a backflush tank. It gathers hardness minerals within its conditioning tank and from time to time flushes them away to drain. Ion exchangers are often used for water softening. When an ion exchanger is applied for water softening, it will replace the calcium and magnesium ions in the water with other ions such as salt or potassium. The outcome of our innovative water softener innovation is healthier, smoother water for you and your household, while still maintaining an effective flow rate.</p>
