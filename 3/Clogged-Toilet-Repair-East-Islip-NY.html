<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
