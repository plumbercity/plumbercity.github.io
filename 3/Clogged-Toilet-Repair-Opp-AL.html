<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a variety of products were used for home plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most typical metals, while clay was utilized for sewer line piping. Although all these materials are durable in the short-term, they degrade over decades.

<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this type of rust A softener is just catching some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (usually salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
