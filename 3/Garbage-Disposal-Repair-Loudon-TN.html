The best method to avoid drain obstructions is to enjoy what you flush. If you take a look at your home's plumbing pipes and see spots, staining, flaking, small imprints or rust, your pipes are wearing away. Corroding pipes are more likely to spring a leak (if they haven't already) and should be changed as soon as possible.</p>
