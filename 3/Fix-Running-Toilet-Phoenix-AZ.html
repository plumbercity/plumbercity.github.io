<p>Sewer lines have one vital role: bring wastewater out of a house or building. Although these homeowners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was certainly good timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in sufficient shape to reline before the problem got worse. Waiting just wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a removed garage. At the least, it would have been a really costly choice.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are typically the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends upon the level of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
