<p>The LAGBC is based upon the 2013 California Green Building Standards Code, typically referred to as "CALGreen" that was established and mandated by the State to attain consistency among the different jurisdictions within the State; lower the building's energy and water usage; decrease waste; and reduce the carbon footprint. Constant feed disposals are simple to operate: you run water in the kitchen sink, flip a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste.
