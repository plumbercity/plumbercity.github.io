<p>Tough water usage may affect the performance of household devices. When heated up, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate settle out of suspension (precipitate) from the water and form a mineral deposit at the bottom of the hot water heater. A large scale accumulation slows the heating process and requires more energy to heat water. Water heaters with large accumulations of mineral buildup will have a much shorter life span. Scale deposits also accumulate to plug plumbing components and build up in other devices such as coffee pots and dishwashers, hence impacting their efficiency.</p>

<p>Denver Water's Cross-Connection Control and Backflow Prevention Program protects the general public water system from pollutants and contaminants that could, under particular circumstances, be drawn into the general public water system from private properties. The cost mainly depends on the toilet you select if you need a new toilet. Toilets vary in design, flushing effectiveness and bowl shape, all of that make some toilets more costly than others.
