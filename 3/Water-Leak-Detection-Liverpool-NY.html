When these components are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>
