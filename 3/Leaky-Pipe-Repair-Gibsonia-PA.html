I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months back. I feel that costs were increased because I had a "Deal". An Angie's list short article from March stated depending upon the marketplace and severity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214.
