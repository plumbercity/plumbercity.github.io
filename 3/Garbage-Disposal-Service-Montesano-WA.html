It is very important that the plumbing system be switched on very slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be checked to ensure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close correctly.
