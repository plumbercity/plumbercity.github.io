<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>It's a strangely complicated clinical procedure, however simple to treat. It uses salt to eliminate minerals and odors discovered in difficult water- most typically calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems use resin beads that attach and bring in salt ions in the softener tank. Pumps press hard water through the resin beads exchanging hardness ions with salt ions, softening the water.</p>
