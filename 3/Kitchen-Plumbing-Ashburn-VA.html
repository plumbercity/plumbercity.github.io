Water pressure may be or fail minimized when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is a suddenly high need on the water system (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe might permit infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
