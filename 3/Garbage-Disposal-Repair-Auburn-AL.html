<p>All you truly need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) as soon as you have actually found the journey lever you desire eliminate your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your brand-new journey lever, location it in the hole where your old journey lever was and secure it.
