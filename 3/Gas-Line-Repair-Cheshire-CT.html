<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of 2 categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a fixed schedule and then go back to service. Due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, generally regrow after so many gallons of water have been softened.
