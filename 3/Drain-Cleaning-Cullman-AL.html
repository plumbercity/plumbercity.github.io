<p>But is a plumbing catastrophe impending or just a concern for the distant future? Replacing old pipes in a 1,500 square foot, two-bathroom home costs $4,000 to $10,000, and requires cutting open walls and floorings, so you certainly don't want to get the job done prior to it's essential. Here's how to evaluate your plumbing system and know when it's time for replacement.</p>
<p>Picture living in a home with soft water-- a home where you do not have weird films on your dishes or mirrors, can lather soap easily, and don't need to stress over scaling on the inside or beyond your appliances.

<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits collect, until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits occur more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned if you want to make twice as sure your toilet is the issue prior to you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs, it's time for a new one.</p>
