<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely pictured. If you have reasonably difficult water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams.
