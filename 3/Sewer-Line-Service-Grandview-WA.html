With decreased energy usage, minimized water consumption, less sewage, and an as needed system, tankless water heaters are a green alternative to warm water tanks. They save energy by only heating the quantity of water needed at a given moment.</p>

After that the softener can be detached, transferred to its new area and positioned there.</p>
<p>Testing need to be completed by a contractor registered with the Cross Connection Control office. The contractor must have a legitimate, up-to-date plumbing license, existing insurance, backflow preventer testing certification, and presently calibrated test package. For testing of fireline backflow preventers, the State's Fire Marshal certificate is required.</p>
