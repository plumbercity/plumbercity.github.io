<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix it Yourself in Irvington NJ 07111!</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these components are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new sodium ions.</p>
