Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
