<p>The brand-new inlets and outlets on the tank do not constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if necessary. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Photo 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You may have to increase or decrease the vent size to ensure the best draft. CARE: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>Insecticide from garden pipes: The extremely poisonous insecticide chlordane was back-siphoned into the water supply.
