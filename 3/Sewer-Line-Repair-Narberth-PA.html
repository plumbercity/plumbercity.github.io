<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- destructive. For this factor, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this type of corrosion A softener is merely recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (generally sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
<p>In reality, reverse flow testing developed to make sure that backflow preventers prevent backflow was gotten rid of from NFPA 25 in 2011.
