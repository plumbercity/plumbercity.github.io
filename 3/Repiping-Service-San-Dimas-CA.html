<p>Here at High 5 Plumbing, our Denver drain cleaning team is proud to use Bio-Clean products for every single drain-cleaning job. Bio-Clean is an all-natural service that's both harmless to your plumbing and remarkably efficient at removing gunk, waste, and natural material that so typically congests your drain lines. Caustic drain cleaners run along the bottom of your pipes, wearing away the sidewalls and just partly repairing the problem. Bio-Clean is a solution of live bacteria that actively look for organic material and eat away at it, creating harmless byproducts of carbon mineral, water, and dioxide ash, all of which are easily treated at local sewage plants.</p>
<p>Non-precipitating water softeners are now based on polymer type ingredients such as salt polycarboxylate. Faulty Parts: If your toilet won't stop running, it's most likely due to problems with a toilet tank part. In such cases, we are generally able to replace that single component.
