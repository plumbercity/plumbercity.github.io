<p>Liquid drain cleaner cost your local home enhancement huge box shop can aid with a few things, however it's really pretty restricted in its ability to fix problems inside your drains and it can be destructive and destructive to lots of kinds of pipes. Unless you have a way to see inside the drain, there is likewise no warranty that drain cleaner is even going to work. When you work with a professional plumber, they have actually specialized tools that will allow them to see inside your drains and recognize the problem, then they have the right tools to fix any kind of problem that you might have.

<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure.

<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your home then exit into the sewer or septic tank from your home. When you experience blockages in multiple drains at once in your house, then that generally means that your main sewer line is backing up. This can occur in multiple areas and any mix of drains. For example, water may fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are several combinations of this type of backup. The point is your drains all link, and as soon as you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from numerous drain lines in your home.</p>

Set a pail under the P-trap and detach the drainpipes. Then remove the sink strainer. Remove any excess putty.</p>
