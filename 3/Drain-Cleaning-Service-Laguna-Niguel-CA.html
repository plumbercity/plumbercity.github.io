<p>Leaks are tricky. If there is no grounded outlet present to power the garbage disposal, you might need to pay for the installation of electrical circuitry. The cost of products for a grounded outlet will likely cost between $5 and $10, and $120 to $165 to employ an electrical expert If your installation requires a new switch, expect to spend an extra $5 to $10 on products, and $50 for labor.</p>
<p>Then connect the waste pipe (and dishwasher hose, if applicable). If your unit is outlet-ready-- focus on this part-- make certain your disposal switch remains in the off" position prior to you plug the new system in.
