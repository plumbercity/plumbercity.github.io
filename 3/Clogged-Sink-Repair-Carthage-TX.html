<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made in between the potable water supply and non-potable water or compounds a backflow assembly is required to be set up. An authorized, appropriately set up and preserved backflow assembly basically gets rid of the risk of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Ensure that the softener is filled with salt or potassium chloride following the producer's recommendations.</p>
<p>When the FutureSoft water softener system is installed, depending on the age of your home and the plumbing will depend on what you will see.

We extremely suggest repiping your home during spring or summertime so you don't have to stress about freezing temperature levels throughout the repiping process if you live in a cold-weather environment.</p>
<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
