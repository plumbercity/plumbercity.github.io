<p>All you really need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) when you've discovered the trip lever you desire eliminate your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your brand-new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old trip lever was and protect it. Bear in mind that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for most toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the appropriate method. When you have actually protected the trip lever and are prepared to link your flapper, ensure you have actually got simply enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the way when you lower on the trip lever.</p>
