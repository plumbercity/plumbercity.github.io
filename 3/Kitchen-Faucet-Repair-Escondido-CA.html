<h3>Why Plumbers Are So Expensive Escondido CA</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede versus the needed direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to guarantee that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the sprinkler system can become polluted. If permitted to re-enter the supply of water, there is potential for the infected water to become a health hazard. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected frequently for efficiency, as well as inspected annually by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
<p>Usually, the cost to replace a toilet varies in between $ 122 and $228, with most house owners investing around $ 150 to $180.

A high-efficiency toilet with additional functions can cost $ 800 to $1,500 to install. The typical installation takes a plumber 2 to 4 hours at $ 65 per hour. If you're replacing an existing toilet, add $ 30 to $50 to remove your old toilet.</p>
