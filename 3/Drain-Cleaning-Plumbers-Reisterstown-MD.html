<p>In water system systems, water is typically kept at a substantial pressure to allow water to stream from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may stop working or be lowered when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an unexpectedly high need on the water supply (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe might allow infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>

Not just can a clogged disposal trigger the sink to drain slowly, it can also cause filthy water to recede into the sink. A waste disposal unit repair service can help identify and fix a clogged garbage disposal.</p>
