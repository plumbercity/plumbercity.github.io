<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Fed Up With False Guarantees? Bad Odors - If nasty odors are emerging from your drain, this is a clear indication your sink is not effectively draining water. Undesirable smells are a direct result of waste-build up in your drain piping. When this build-up accumulates, it can lead to stronger smells, and more extreme piping problems. Without practical draining, extreme pressure can cause your piping system to break and leak leading to expensive water damage.</p>
<p>When in awhile, every toilet clogs. How often a toilet clogs depends on the strength of its flush, the cleanliness of its drain pipes, and what it's attempting to flush. If your toilet blocks more than when a month-or even as soon as a week!- it's most likely due to the fact that mineral deposits have actually built up around the top of the drain or in the drain pipes themselves.</p>

<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water technology start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, announced today they have attained a breakthrough in water softening treatment using a proprietary Surface area Accelerated Formation (SACr) technology. SACr physically eliminates short-term firmness without utilizing chemicals or high pressure, which are significant limitations of existing softening technologies.</p>
