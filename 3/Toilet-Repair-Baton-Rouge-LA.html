<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a range of materials were used for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most typical metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping. Although all these products are durable in the short-term, they weaken over years.

After about fifty years, they'll begin to deteriorate from corrosion and may position toxins into the freshwater supply. We advise changing the iron, clay, and steel pipes in your home.
