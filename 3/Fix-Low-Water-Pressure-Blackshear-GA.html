<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
