<p>Low water pressure. Your plumbing is delicate to water pressure and counts on a great balance of water pressure in order to work efficiently. If your showers end up being disappointing, or it appears little to no water is draining of your faucets, it might be time for a sewer repair. The cost depends on the size of the home and the variety of bathrooms and plumbing fixtures-- laundry room, wet bar, mud room, etc. The cost to repair the drywall that was cut into to gain access to the plumbing will include $500 or more to your final costs.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely pictured. If you have moderately hard water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
