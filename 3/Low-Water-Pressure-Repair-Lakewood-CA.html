<p>Last but not least, the most sophisticated and complex backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five individually operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. During standard water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if expensive) device is best used in important areas where cross contamination could be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
