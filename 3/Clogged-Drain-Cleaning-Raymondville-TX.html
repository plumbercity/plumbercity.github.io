<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts may have really tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An important thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the component. The guide is a really vital part of the design of each component. If the part is not fixed effectively, the guide could limit the motion (instead of consistent or direct) of the element, which might trigger the component to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
