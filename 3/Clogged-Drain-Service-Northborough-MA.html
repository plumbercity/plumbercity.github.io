<p>Every toilet obstructions once in awhile. How often a toilet clogs depends upon the strength of its flush, the cleanliness of its drain pipes, and what it's trying to flush.

<p>Your disposer might include a thin rubber gasket to be utilized under the sink flange, instead of the conventional plumber's putty as laid out listed below.

Some even prefer silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to eliminate.</p>
<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers and that may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another visit, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>
