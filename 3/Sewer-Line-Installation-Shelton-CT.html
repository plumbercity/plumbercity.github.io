In truth, Carbon monoxide gas poisoning is a typical effect of neglected gas line repair tasks. Outside of physical damage, gas line leakages can also trigger severe damage to your pipes, meaning more of your hard-earned cash invested in repairs.</p>

The cross connection control program is required by the State of Michigan's Safe Drinking Water Act 1976 PA 399.
