At that time, individuals had no idea that the lead in the pipes might seep into the drinking water, let alone the health dangers associated with lead.</p>
<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water heater, dishwasher, and boiler, it's leaving behind hard, crusty mineral deposits. At first, these little deposits are safe, however over time they develop and ultimately clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can dramatically limit the water flow, which puts undue pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>

<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Photo 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on particular new sinks, however these will be labeled to that effect. If you can't utilize plumber's putty, utilize a non-water-based silicone. Excess putty will squeeze out between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in place. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to place the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without catching on the gasket.</p>
