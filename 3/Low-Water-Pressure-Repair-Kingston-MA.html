<p>For an outdoor gas light or appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a clog or can cause rust that obstructs the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Noise-- Over time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets hard and takes away from the capability of your water heater. This solidified sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is minor, however if you have actually been advised by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low sodium diet this increase can pose problems.</p>
