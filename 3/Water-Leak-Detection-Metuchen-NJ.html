Recurring leaks and repairs. If your hot water heater is over 10 years old, it has actually likely lost much of its effectiveness; continuing to repair it, with its regular breakdowns, is not cost-effective in the long run. As an outcome, we advise replacing your system if it is over ten years old.</p>

According to Sankarasubramanian et al., The mean per capita water use each day is higher in rural counties than metropolitan counties in all the climate regions, except in the Central and Southeast regions"1 with rural areas having less efficient supply of water systems2 primarily due to the relative absence of funds to upgrade and keep their systems. So, the higher per capita intake" of water in backwoods may include substantial non-revenue water losses from their distribution pipelines.
