For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to harden and split or just be so squished that it does not fill the space as well as it used to, and you wind up with water all over the location. Just like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become so used or corroded that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly suggest also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to ensure whatever is in tip-top shape.</p>
