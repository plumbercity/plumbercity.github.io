<h3>Most Effective Drain Cleaning Methods El Segundo CA</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's cable television, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's DIY task. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
