<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Usually, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in salt is minor, but if you've been advised by a doctor to follow a strict low sodium diet plan this boost can posture problems.</p>
