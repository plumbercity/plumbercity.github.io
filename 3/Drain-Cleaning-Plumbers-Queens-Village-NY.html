<p>A Water Softener is a filtration system that works to eliminate high concentrations of calcium and magnesium that cause difficult water. The system filters out these hard water minerals and the softened water then leaves the water softening system to flow through plumbing when water streams through a Water Softener. State certified backflow technicians, available through your grass irrigation company or plumber can figure out whether or not your equipment meets the requirements. The guidelines also require a state certified backflow specialist test the backflow preventer annually.</p>
