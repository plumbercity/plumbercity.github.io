If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>

<p>Caution: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on a lot of rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. Because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however in most cases it should be much less water.</p>
