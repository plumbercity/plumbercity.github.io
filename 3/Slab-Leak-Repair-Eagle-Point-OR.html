<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Usually, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in sodium is minor, but if you've been advised by a doctor to follow a strict low sodium diet this increase can position problems.</p>

Carrying occurs when the incoming tough water follows a narrow path through the softener's resin bed and does not exchange ions with the resin, leaving your water unsoftened.
