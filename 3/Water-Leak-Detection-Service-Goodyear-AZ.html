I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another visit, they called him back and he said he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
