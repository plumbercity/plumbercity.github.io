<p>No other room in a home contains as many pipes and plumbing components as the bathroom. We now have actually cleaned and examined the parts, changed the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their elements, cleaned the body and the seats and flushed the incoming water line. We are now prepared to start the re-assembly procedure. Some models need the components to be removed in a particular order. These assemblies will likewise need the re-assembly in a particular order. Lots of components can not be re-installed into the body unless the test dicks are left open. As each element is put back into the body, it is important to put them back in the correct place. It is also important that as they are put back into the body, that no foreign matter is connected on the parts or accidentally put in the body. The components must be put so that the guides are able to maintain their developed tolerances.</p>
<p>When a big sufficient source of water has actually been determined and evaluated, the third major element of a water supply system enters into play: a system of pipelines to convey the water from its source to its consumers. The biggest of these primary long-distance sending pipes are referred to as aqueducts. Generally constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) enhanced concrete pipe segments, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable coating, these are huge underground and aboveground pipes designed to bring bulk flow amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and distribution nodes where the flows are transferred to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. Many large cities need several aqueducts providing water from geographically apart and diverse sources.</p>
