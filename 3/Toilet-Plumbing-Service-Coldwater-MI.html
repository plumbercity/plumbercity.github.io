<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends on the level of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
