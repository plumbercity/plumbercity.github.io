<p>Physical strength. Pipefitters, steamfitters, and plumbers must have the ability to lift and move heavy tools and materials. Suggestion: Place a heavy item such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation. Loosen up the clamp and remove the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Trying to clean the pipes or treat the water with chemicals will not fix the issue, as the pipes are deteriorating slowly from the inside. Most of the times, repiping is your only practical option.</p>
