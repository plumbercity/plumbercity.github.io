<p>All of the drains in your house, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then exit into the sewer or septic tank from your home. Then that usually indicates that your main sewer line is backing up when you experience blockages in several drains at when in your home. This can occur in several places and any mix of drains. For example, water may fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are a number of combinations of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and as soon as you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from numerous drain lines in your house.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits collect, up until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits happen more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a new one.</p>
