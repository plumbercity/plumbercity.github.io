<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components might have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is a very vital part of the design of each element. If the element is not repaired appropriately, the guide could limit the movement (rather than direct or stable) of the component, which might cause the part to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
