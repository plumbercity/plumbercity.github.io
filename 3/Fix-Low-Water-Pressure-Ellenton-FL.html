<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank don't always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if necessary. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a brand-new ball valve while you're at it (Photo 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You might have to increase or reduce the vent size to ensure the best draft. CAUTION: If you're uncertain if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>It's important to be conscious that a lot of scale and mineral build-up in toilet bowls is triggered by difficult water if your problem is more associated to scale and mineral build-up.
