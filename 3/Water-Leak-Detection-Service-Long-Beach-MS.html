<h3>Kitchen Faucet Repair in Long Beach Mississippi</h2>
<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water technology start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, announced today they have actually achieved a development in water softening treatment utilizing an exclusive Surface Accelerated Formation (SACr) technology. SACr physically removes short-term solidity without using chemicals or high pressure, which are significant restrictions of existing softening innovations.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health danger for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Usually, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is minor, but if you've been encouraged by a physician to follow a strict low sodium diet this boost can position problems.</p>
