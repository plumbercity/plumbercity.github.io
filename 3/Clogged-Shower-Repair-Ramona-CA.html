<p>Foul Sewer Smell: One of the first most apparent indications of a sewer concern is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a basic problem such as a broken water seal, or it can suggest a larger problem such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can prevent major damage to your home. Even if the problem comes from with the municipal system, it's still clever to bring in the experts to limit the damage to your house.</p>
<p>Understand that most types of disposals need a switch adjacent to the sink to manage the outlet-- the electrician needs to wire for this, too. Keep in mind: Batch-feed disposers don't require a switch since they begin when you insert and turn a special drain plug. The purpose of the plumbing code is to insure the correct installation of systems for providing potable water, for hygienic sewage disposal and storm drainage; and to insure public security, health, and welfare insofar as impacted by the installation of plumbing.</p>
