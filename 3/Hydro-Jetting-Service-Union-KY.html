Watering backflow prevention assemblies must be tested by a certified backflow assembly tester as the water is turned on to make sure proper backflow prevention is in place to secure our drinking water during the irrigation season. Denver Water will send out a testing tip notice 1 month before the annual test is due.</p>
<p>In order to prevent your drains from getting clogged in the future, pay attention to what is being cleaned down your system.
