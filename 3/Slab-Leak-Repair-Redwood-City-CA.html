Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or natural gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is an extremely pure type of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
