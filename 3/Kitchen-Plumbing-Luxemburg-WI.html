<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code secures the general public water system and private on-site water supply and circulation systems by prohibiting cross-connections in between drinkable (ideal for drinking) and non-potable water supply, and by requiring installation of secondary and main backflow prevention approaches. Secondary backflow techniques offer an increased level of security for the general public supply of water system.</p>

Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material.

Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is minor, but if you've been encouraged by a physician to follow a stringent low sodium diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>
