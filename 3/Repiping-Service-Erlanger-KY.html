<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Erlanger KY</h3>
<p>Rusty water: If you have rusty water coming out of your faucets, especially if that water is hot, the inside of your unit is most likely rusty. If it only occurs with warm water, you will likely have to replace your hot water heater. If you resemble many homeowners, you probably do not know what type of pipes you have. A plumber from 1st Choice Plumbing can tell you for sure, but in basic, there are three main types of pipes that tend to have problems.</p>
<p>This article intends to attend to the common misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes rust This is not the case: a properly configured water softener does not make the treated water more destructive. Here are a few complicated facts that frequently lead individuals to this erroneous conclusion. Initially, naturally soft water is typically destructive. For that reason, softened water must also be destructive, right? This is a fallacy due to the fact that naturally soft water tends to be destructive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening triggers neither of these conditions.</p>
