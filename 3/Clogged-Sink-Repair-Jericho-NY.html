<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals state, does not the water pressure in the water system keep the watering water from going backwards? Yes, most of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a frequent incident, but it does occur more frequently than you think! Typically it occurs in the evening when you don't discover the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or link a new pipe. This makes construction tasks easily the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common cause of backflow. Fire trucks use big pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
