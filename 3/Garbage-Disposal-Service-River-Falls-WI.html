<p>The average cost of a batch feed garbage disposal is $100-$ 350 across the country, depending on the size and design.

<p>Metal alloys are prone to an electro-chemical condition called corrosion. Corrosion can literally consume a metal away causing the metal to not be as strong as it initially was or modify the tolerances causing parts to not work in a backflow preventer. The result of deterioration on a metal alloy should be examined to figure out if the part is usable or need to be replaced.</p>
<p>The labor costs for disposal installation are mainly time related. If whatever is prepared, in excellent condition, and the disposal is on hand and quickly put in, the plumber will likely only charge for an hour or 2 of time. If things need to be modified, replaced, or moved to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours needed and therefore the total costs. Many plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with the majority of disposal installations running $50 per hour for 3 hours total, making the labor expenses approximately $150.</p>
