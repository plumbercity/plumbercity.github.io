Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
