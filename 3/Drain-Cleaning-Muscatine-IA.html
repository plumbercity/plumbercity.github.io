<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Muscatine IA</h3>
<p>Many homes or structures that were built in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to rust. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather security. As the external finishing of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>Changing your flapper might require a little different actions than we reveal (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an unusual flush valve, finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task. To find an appropriate replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Shut off the water before getting rid of the flapper.) You may not find an identical match, but possibilities are you'll locate one of the same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
