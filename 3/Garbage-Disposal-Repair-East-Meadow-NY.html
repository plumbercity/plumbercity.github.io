<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from regular flow instructions within a piping system that is caused by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of normal flow in a system brought on by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water supply piping). Back-siphonage can take place when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is decreased main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>Some pipe products are cheaper than others; some are more vulnerable and brittle to cracking, displacement or other kinds of structural failure. Other products are prone to deterioration and rust while some are untouched. Certain pipe materials have greater coefficients of heat stress, making them more susceptible to structural stresses and stress as an outcome of temperature level change and ice formation. And these distinctions dictate the prospective need for backflow preventers.</p>
