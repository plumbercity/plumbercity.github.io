<p>Making use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic deterioration Direct contact between dissimilar metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 various types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created because of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
