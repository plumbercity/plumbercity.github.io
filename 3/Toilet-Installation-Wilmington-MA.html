<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize when backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
