<p>No other room in a home contains as many pipes and plumbing fixtures as the bathroom. When replacing an under-sink assembly, look for quality products. Prevent flex pipe that can be bent into any configuration, along with flexible rubber traps. Particles can easily capture in this type of piping while the piping's flexible nature does not provide needed support for the drain basket. PVC assemblies are a great choice s they can be quickly connected to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and make certain it sets before testing the drain.</p>

<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on specific brand-new sinks, but these will be identified to that effect. If you can't utilize plumber's putty, utilize a non-water-based silicone. When you tighten up the locknut in location, excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without catching on the gasket.</p>
