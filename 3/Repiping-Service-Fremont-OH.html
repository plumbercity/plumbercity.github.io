<p>Dual Examine Valve - Design GF8080, GF8080E - The Double Inspect Valve or double backflow prevention valve is essentially a stripped down Double Check Valve without shut down valves and test cocks. They are non-testable and are normally used by public utility and set up after a water meter to avoid the meter from running backwards and low security versus backflow. This tool is the center of debate with lots of backflow authorities and should never ever be confused with Check Valves. Contact local authorities for needed installation, as most do not acknowledge these as backflow prevention devices.</p>
