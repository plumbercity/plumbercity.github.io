<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is extensively thought of. If you have reasonably tough water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
