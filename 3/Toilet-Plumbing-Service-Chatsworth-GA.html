<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>

The resulting soft water system is without hardness ions without any other ions being added. Membranes are a kind of water filter needing routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
