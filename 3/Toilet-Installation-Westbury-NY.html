It's time to speak with the experts if your water heater isn't doing its only job.</p>
<p>Water softening describes the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular method of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. Throughout ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another kind of ion-- normally sodium. The outcome is water that's been effectively softened by eliminating almost all traces of the minerals that constitute difficult water.</p>
