<p>As soon as you've found the trip lever you desire, all you really need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) remove your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your brand-new journey lever, place it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Bear in mind that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for most toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the right method. When you have actually protected the journey lever and are ready to hook up your flapper, make sure you've got just enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still raising all the method when you push down on the journey lever.</p>
