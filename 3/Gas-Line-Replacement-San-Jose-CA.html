<p>PEX is made from a versatile piping product that is low-cost and easy to install and is resistant to acidic compounds. However, it can not be utilized outside since it is damaged by UV light, and it can not be directly linked to a water heater.

This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
