<h3>Emergency Plumbing Tips For Your Everyday Plumber Lynbrook NY</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Insecticide from garden pipes: The highly poisonous insecticide chlordane was back-siphoned into the water system. An extermination company employee had actually left one end of a garden hose in a barrel of diluted insecticide and the other linked to an external house hose bibb (outside spigot). When the water system system pressure dropped due to repair work, the chlordane was sucked back through the house into the water system.</p>
