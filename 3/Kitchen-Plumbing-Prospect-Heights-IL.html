Ion exchangers are typically utilized for water softening. When an ion exchanger is applied for water softening, it will replace the calcium and magnesium ions in the water with other ions such as sodium or potassium. The result of our advanced water softener innovation is healthier, smoother water for you and your family, while still maintaining an efficient circulation rate.</p>
