Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is really low.

For that reason when evaporated water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>

<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual option is to have the defective pipes replaced. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is a choice to think about if you live in an older house - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for many decades, but steel ultimately suffers from corrosion and lacks the toughness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
