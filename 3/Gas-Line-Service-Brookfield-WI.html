<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends on the extent of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

Normally, minerals get there because groundwater will liquify rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the residues take a trip with the water till it remains in your home. Water softening uses an ion exchange process to eliminate liquified minerals that aren't as effectively removed by mechanical filtration. These products are what triggers hard water.</p>
