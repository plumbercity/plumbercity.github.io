<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water boiler, heater, and dishwasher, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits. In the beginning, these small deposits are harmless, however with time they build up and eventually clog pipes, seize valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In severe cases, hard-water deposits can dramatically restrict the water flow, which puts unnecessary pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>

<p>Chelation: Another approach is to introduce a chemical compound that functions as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and remain suspended in the water instead of building up on surface areas. Nevertheless, if they remain in one place for long, as they might in a water heater, the accumulation could still happen.</p>
