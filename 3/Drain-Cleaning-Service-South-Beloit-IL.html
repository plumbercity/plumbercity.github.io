<p>A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Rather than dislodging the blockage with unfavorable pressure, it really pushes into the clog, working further into where the blockage is occurring. The auger or snake" is then used to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to flow freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped tip helps require it further down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems normally are installed in big, unheated locations, such as parking lot. These systems have actually pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler triggers due to heat, the air is launched, enabling the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is released through the open sprinkler head to reduce the fire.</p>
