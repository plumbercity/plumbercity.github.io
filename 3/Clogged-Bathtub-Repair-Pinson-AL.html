<p>A freshly set up hot water heater must not produce strange sounds, however it will start to produce rumbling noises as it ages. The sounds get louder over time as the heater runs to heat up the water. Things get worse dramatically for homes with a high need for warm water. The reasons for the noises can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which should be flushed to bring back normalcy. A water heater replacement might be essential if the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has actually been flushed.</p>
