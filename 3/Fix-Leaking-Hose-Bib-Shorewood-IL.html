<p>A recently set up water heater must not produce weird noises, however it will begin to produce rumbling sounds as it ages. The sounds get louder over time as the heater goes to heat the water.

A hot water heater replacement might be required if the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has been flushed.</p>
