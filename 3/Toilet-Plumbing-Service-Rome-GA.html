<p>Climatic Vacuum Breaker - Model GFAVB - The atmospheric vacuum breaker is one of the least costly backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable system and are good for back siphonage just for non-health threat or health threat conditions. They need to be set up downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. , if an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on a watering system you need to install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.. It needs to also be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local authorities, need that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the greatest outlet). Some towns do not allow the usage of GFAVB's. These systems will NOT avoid backflow pressure and can just secure against back siphonage.</p>
