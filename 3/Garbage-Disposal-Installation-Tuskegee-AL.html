Expense Howe knows water heaters, inside and out.</p>
<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years of ages and you need to hire a plumber for that burner package. The total repair expense might be in the $300 variety. A gas hot water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800).
