<p>A water softener has 2 tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the actual ion exchange, or water softening, takes place. It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the salt, or salt, is saved and combined with water. , if you plan to drain your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate undamaged if you will not use your unit to drain a dishwasher.</p>
<p>Responsive circulation technology works by constantly bringing tanks on-line and off-line in reaction to the water demands of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, only one of the four tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill up. This responsive style permits the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than traditional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
