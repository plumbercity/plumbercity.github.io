<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers and that may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return because he had another consultation. A best bad plumber story.</p>

As it gets worn, it can begin to solidify and split or just be so crushed that it does not fill the area along with it utilized to, and you end up with water all over the location. Much like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become so used or corroded that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly recommend also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything remains in good shape.</p>
