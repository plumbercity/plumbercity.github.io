<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Instead of dislodging the blockage with negative pressure, it in fact presses into the clog, working even more into where the obstruction is taking place. The auger or snake" is then used to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to flow easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped idea helps force it further down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>
