A water heater is essentially a household appliance that consists of a gas or electrical heating unit under a tank in which water is heated up and saved. You do not need a plumbing authorization for simple repairs such as unclogging a sink or if a plumbing license is issued as part of a bigger residential building permit or commercial building license.</p>

This method works best for cleaning out drains clogged with hair and particles, such as sinks and showers.
