<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Camp Hill PA</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can easily cause countless dollars in water damage, disrupt your household for weeks, and throw your remodel way off schedule. So working with a licensed, insured master plumber (or a well-trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. But not all plumbers manage all types of work. Their responsibilities break out into two classifications: Plumbers who handle standard repairs (typically in emergency situations), and plumbers who specialize in renovating tasks and additions.</p>
