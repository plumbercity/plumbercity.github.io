<p>Lots of homeowners will see a clog and immediately grab a bottle of store-bought, chemical drain cleaner. While this kind of chemical may do the job, it's really quite damaging to your pipes. Chemical drain cleaners frequently utilize lye as the active ingredient. Lye is developed to penetrate blockages and liquify them, but it also penetrates your pipes and creates weak spots that are vulnerable to burst.</p>

For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water.

<p>When you have actually discovered the journey lever you desire, all you actually need to do is (CAREFULLY!) eliminate your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank.
