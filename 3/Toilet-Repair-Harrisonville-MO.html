Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak.

As the outer finishing of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>Repiping a home takes 3 to five days with an average cost from $5,500 to $8,500, depending on home's size and the company doing the work. Wood recommends inspecting the credentials of different companies and getting estimates.
