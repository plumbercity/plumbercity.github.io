While a few of these concerns can be credited to regular wear and tear or incorrect installation, sometimes your waste disposal unit ends up being harmed by items that shouldn't be gone through it.</p>
<p>To connect a power cable to the new unit, eliminate the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and join the colored wires found inside with their equivalents in the cord, utilizing wire nuts.
