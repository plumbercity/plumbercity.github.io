<p>Last but not least, the most advanced and complex backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five independently running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other four. During basic water flows at style pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if expensive) device is best utilized in vital locations where cross contamination could be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
<p>Checking the water meter is an excellent next action in your plumbing inspection. Close all faucets and check if the water meter is turning.

This goes for every other shut off valve and their matching faucets. You are off to a great start if everything is working properly.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound drinkable supply of water. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
