Unfortunately, water held in the sprinkler system can become infected. If permitted to return to the water supply, there is potential for the infected water to become a health danger. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for effectiveness, along with inspected each year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
