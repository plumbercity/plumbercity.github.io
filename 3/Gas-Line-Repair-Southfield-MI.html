The GFAVB is a non-testable system and benefit back siphonage only for non-health danger or health hazard conditions. They need to be installed downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on a watering system you need to install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It needs to also be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local officials, require that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet). Some towns do not permit the usage of GFAVB's. These systems will NOT avoid backflow pressure and can only protect versus back siphonage.</p>
