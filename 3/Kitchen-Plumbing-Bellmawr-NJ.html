<p>Every day, the drains in your house effectively remove big amounts of water and waste. With time, dirt, particles, hair, and many other small particles can get caught and develop in your pipes. Eventually, the water may not be able to drain rapidly or efficiently, and you might experience water pooling in your bathroom sink or a toilet that is constantly supporting. It might be time to call on a professional from Atlas Plumbing to investigate when this happens.</p>
<p>Passive Purge - As much as 2007, some houses were permitted to forego a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with use of several toilets in the home. Normally, the supply of water to among the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire sprinkler system; upon each use, fresh water was presented into the fire lawn sprinkler.</p>
<p>If you don't have a plumber's snake, you can utilize a wire coat hanger by aligning it. Naturally, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it may be long enough to reach some obstructions. If you can reach it, insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to press through or pull out the clog. Beware not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
