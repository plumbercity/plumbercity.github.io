<p>streaming backwards by blocking the flow using drifts or springloaded valves, and (3) vacuum breaker devices vent air from pipe to avoid and equalize the pressure siphonage. These devices are often integrated into single items to increase their effectiveness, such as double check valve assemblies (consisting of two successive independent check valves (DCVA)) and Reverse-pressure principle backflow preventers (two inline check valves with a pressure relief valve situated between them to dispose out any backflow water (RPD)).</p>
