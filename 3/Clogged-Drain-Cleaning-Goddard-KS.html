Again, the best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air gap, if there is no way to provide one, then we inspect to see that the proper BFP device is installed.

<p>Iron or manganese fouling: Iron or manganese that has been exposed to air or chlorine can clog the resin and avoid it from working. This is referred to as fouling. In some cases it might be required to filter the water prior to it gets to your softener to prevent fouling. If the resin ends up being fouled, commercial cleaners are available. Cleaners need to be used according to producer directions to avoid contamination.</p>
