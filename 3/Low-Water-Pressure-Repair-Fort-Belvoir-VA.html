<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components might have extremely tight tolerances that need to be preserved. An essential thing to determine on each component is the guide.

If the part is not fixed effectively, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than direct or constant) of the element, which could trigger the element to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
