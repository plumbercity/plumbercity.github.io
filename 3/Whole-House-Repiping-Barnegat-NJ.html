So, if you observe any of the following signs when you have had your disposal for about this quantity of time, then you are best about all set for a new one.

<p>It's Making sounds - As your water heats up, there are minerals that are falling and separating to your tank's bottom. This will trigger it to work more difficult and can create noise. If your energy costs are increasing, a new, higher performance hot water heater can bring them pull back.
