Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line.
