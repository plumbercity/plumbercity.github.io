<p>A recently installed hot water heater should not produce strange noises, however it will begin to create rumbling sounds as it ages. The noises get louder over time as the heater goes to warm the water. Things get worse drastically for homes with a high demand for hot water. The factors for the sounds can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which should be flushed to restore normalcy. A hot water heater replacement might be required if the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has been flushed.</p>
<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automatic shut-off to prevent overfilling.
