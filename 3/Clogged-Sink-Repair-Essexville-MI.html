<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
