<p>Seattle Public Utilities checks backflow assemblies upon installation and conducts regular re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies should be checked by a State of Washington certified backflow assembly tester prior to taking into service. A copy of the test report must be supplied to us. Get cleaner clothes, eliminate rust spots, and use less detergent when you soften your laundry water. Whole-house designs are suitable for washing devices, or you can attempt laundry additive water softening items.</p>

Our plumbers will find any leaks and correctly seal them. 4 - The regrowth solution (CO2-enriched water) streams from the regrowth storage tank (4) to the exchanger filter. Sump and sedimentation manholes separate the stormwater from hygienic water, lowering the volume and cost of treatment. Culvert repair diverts storm run-off and minimizes disintegration and run-off. Shoring supports trench walls and secures staff members from cave-ins. Shoring likewise supports exposed utilities till the ground is restored.</p>
<p>Metal alloys are prone to an electro-chemical condition called corrosion. Rust can actually consume a metal away triggering the metal to not be as strong as it initially was or alter the tolerances causing parts to not work in a backflow preventer.

Backflow preventers have springs, rubber seals and other moving parts that wear with time and it is very important that they receivethe same regular maintenance that your car or A/C system gets to ensure your family's water is safe & clean.</p>
