However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is extensively envisioned. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams.
