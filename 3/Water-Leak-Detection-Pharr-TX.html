Some components may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is a really crucial part of the style of each component. If the part is not repaired properly, the guide could restrict the movement (instead of direct or steady) of the element, which might trigger the element to not work to its capabilities.

In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
