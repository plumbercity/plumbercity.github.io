<p>In some communities, house water softeners drain to community wastewater treatment plants, which are not designed to remove chloride. The chloride passes through the treatment plant and ends up in our streams and lakes.

<p>The water utilized to restore the softener beads winds up as waste. Other indications that your drain line need to be cleaned consist of odd smells originating from the drain itself, decreased water pressure from the tap, or overflowing water or waste from a sink or toilet.
