<p>A cross-connection is any momentary or long-term connection in between a public water supply or customer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping in between a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or watering system.</p>

Nevertheless, if your harmed pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or walkways, dig-free pipe lining could save you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a pail under the P-trap and disconnect the drainpipes. Then eliminate the sink strainer. Get rid of any excess putty.</p>
