<p>Your house's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not actually the flow of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you pour down there won't go through.</p>
