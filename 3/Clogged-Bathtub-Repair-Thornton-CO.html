When these elements are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
