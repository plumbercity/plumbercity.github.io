Throughout regeneration, salty water from the salt water tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank.

Nonetheless, they have actually shown to be the most reliable. Your choice depends on what you value many. In general, the three most important factors for choosing between the two types of waste disposers are safety, money, and quantity of waste.</p>
