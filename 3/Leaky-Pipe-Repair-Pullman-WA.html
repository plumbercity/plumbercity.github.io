<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits accumulate, till they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits occur more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe.
