Remember that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for most toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the right way. When you've protected the journey lever and are all set to hook up your flapper, make certain you have actually got simply enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the method when you push down on the journey lever.</p>
