<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems usually are installed in areas where water might trigger disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and locations with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>

The policies also need a state certified backflow service technician test the backflow preventer yearly.</p>
