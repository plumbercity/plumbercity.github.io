<h3>Emergency Plumbing Tips For Your Everyday Plumber Grafton OH</h3>
<p>The brand-new inlets and outlets on the tank don't always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if required. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a brand-new ball valve while you're at it (Image 6). Vent sizes are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You might need to increase or decrease the vent size to ensure the best draft. CARE: If you're uncertain if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>Not all toilet problems require the assistance of a professional. Some minor obstructions can be looked after with a plunger and typically, when the toilet won't stop running, it's a simple matter of replacing the chain on the flapper valve inside the tank. However, certain issues do require an experienced plumber, and it's important to know the distinction to avoid lost time, cash, and aggravation.</p>
