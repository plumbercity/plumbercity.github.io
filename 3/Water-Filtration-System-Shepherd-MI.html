<p>The majority of houses or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather defense. As the outer finish of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
