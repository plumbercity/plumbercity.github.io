<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Per Hour Salem MO</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>That is an indication the tank is failing and will need to be replaced if the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank. Schedule an estimate as quickly as possible and make sure absolutely nothing is near the heater that might be possibly harmed if it is in a garage and a little slow leak. Leaking water heaters can burst causing water damage and flooding of homes.</p>
