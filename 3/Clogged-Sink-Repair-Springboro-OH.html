<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements might have extremely tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An important thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is a very important part of the style of each part. If the component is not repaired appropriately, the guide might restrict the movement (instead of steady or direct) of the part, which might trigger the element to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
