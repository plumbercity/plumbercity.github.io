<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself task. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
