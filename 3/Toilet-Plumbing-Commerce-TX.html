<h2>Tips To Hire Affordable Plumbing Contractors in Commerce</h2>

<p>Your sewer line is one of the most vital parts of your household plumbing - and if it becomes clogged or damaged, it could wreak unwanted issues on your property. A house's service line (also called a sewer lateral) ranges from your home to the mainline sewer in the street. For the most part, the homeowner is responsible for preserving the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is responsible for maintaining the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>Next, examine the body. Depending on the size and manufacturer, the bodies can be made of bronze, plastic, stainless steel, cast iron or ductile iron.
