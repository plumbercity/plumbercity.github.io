<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic deterioration Direct contact between dissimilar metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed since of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>

Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is an exceptionally pure form of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
