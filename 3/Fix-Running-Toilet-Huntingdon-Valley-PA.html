<p>Sewer lines have one essential role: bring wastewater out of a house or building. Although these homeowners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was certainly great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in good enough shape to reline prior to the problem worsened. Waiting just wasn't a choice. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a removed garage. At the least, it would have been a very costly alternative.</p>

If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened several fire hydrants to assist battle a fire, the pressure in the water main could drop. The demand upstream might trigger a turnaround in flow.</p>
