<p>Demand loads, no matter what their use, should be met by an adequately sized water system, which constitutes the second significant element of a water supply system. With adequate tank capacity to satisfy variable peak load need, the supply of water source can provide a steady flow of water. Throughout hours of low need, the water circulation can be utilized to refill storage tanks, towers and tanks, which then provide water for emergency usage and periods when need exceeds the standard pumping rate. A supply of water source can take many types, including groundwater extraction well fields, free-flowing rivers, manufactured or natural ponds, artesian springs, ocean water desalination plants, and rainwater run-off collection systems.</p>
<p>Hard water is triggered by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to remove these minerals. When the water can be found in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the service by the salt ions.</p>
