<p>We need to clarify a little terminology before we proceed with a backflow prevention assembly repair. A backflow prevention assembly consists of an inlet and outlet shut down, properly located test cocks, and the needed parts of the assembly (check valves, relief valve or air inlet). Each part can further be broken down into its parts. For instance a first check is a component. A part can even more be broken down into its individual parts (check discs, springs, disc holder etc). Backflow parts are put together to make components, and components are assembled to make a backflow prevention assembly.</p>

<p>Pro Tip: If you're going to be draining a dishwasher through the unit, now is the best time to remove the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Utilize a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet up until the plug is broken off; retrieve the little piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is likewise the ideal time to make the connections for a hardwired system with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
