<p>CPM Plumbing concentrates on quick service, precise troubleshooting, and accuracy repairs so your business never has to experience downtime. One thing to understand about gas lines is they can be exceptionally dangerous if there is a leak. While gas leaks are rare, you need to get out of the building immediately if you observe an odor like rotten eggs in your property.

<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws just won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends on the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
