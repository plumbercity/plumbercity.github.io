<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product covered with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water streams through the system while the resin launches its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
