It is very important that the plumbing system be switched on extremely slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be inspected to guarantee no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close effectively when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are entirely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
