<p>The majority of backflow preventers are designed to allow the elements to be removed for repair while the main body stays installed in the piping system. Removing the backflow preventer to repair it is not needed for the most part. Some components such as relief valve bodies may need to be removed from the main body to assist in a repair. Understanding the appropriate order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be crucial.</p>

<p>Passive Purge - Up to 2007, some houses were permitted to forego a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with use of one or more toilets in the home. Generally, the supply of water to among the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire lawn sprinkler; upon each usage, fresh water was presented into the fire sprinkler system.</p>
<p>The proper repair of a backflow preventer needs many items to be assessed. The hydraulic conditions present at the backflow prevention assembly need to be examined. The installation needs to be evaluated to guarantee it does not circumvent the operations of the assembly. Test information need to be collected to determine the functions of each element. The backflow prevention assembly must be dismantled and parts changed with original factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly need to be tested once again to be sure it was correctly fixed. Comparing the test results from the fixed backflow prevention assembly to the makers flowchart is needed to ensure it was fixed properly. An effectively fixed assembly needs to provide years of defense.</p>
