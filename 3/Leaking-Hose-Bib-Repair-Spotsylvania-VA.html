<p>An overall repipe of a house's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and costly plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole house repiping. Getting the job done by a professional from Art Plumbing, Air Conditioning & Electric will prevent extra expenses, threats and inexpedient purchases.

<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a major public health risk if they do not have adequate backflow prevention assemblies set up.

<p>Single flush High Effectiveness Toilets (HETs) use 1.28 gallons per flush. The most recent double flush HET provided by Bonney will use an average of 1.1 gallons per flush.

Correct care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its guarantee and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
