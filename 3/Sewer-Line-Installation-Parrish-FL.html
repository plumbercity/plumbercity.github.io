Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity.
