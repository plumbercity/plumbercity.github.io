<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber King NC</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's DIY project. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
