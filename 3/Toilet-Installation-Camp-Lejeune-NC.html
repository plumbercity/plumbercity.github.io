<p>A video camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to collect your lawn. During a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain specialist runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images recorded by the camera, we can pinpoint any sewer and drain line problems, such as obstructions, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
