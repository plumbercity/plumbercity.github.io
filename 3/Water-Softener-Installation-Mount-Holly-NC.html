<h3>Plumbing Repairs & Services In Mount Holly NC</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's DIY project. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
