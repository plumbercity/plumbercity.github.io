<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one ought to initially think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these aspects are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new sodium ions.</p>
