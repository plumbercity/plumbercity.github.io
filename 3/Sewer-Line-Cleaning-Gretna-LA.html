<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
