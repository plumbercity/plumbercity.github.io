<p>If you're coping with reduced pressure from scale-ridden pipes, dry hair, stiff laundry, and limitless device repair costs, you need a water softener. Difficult water is not a problem that will disappear by itself and the costs incurred by tough water will only continue to escalate.

Your circulation rate will continue to restrict and you risk losing water pressure throughout the house if scale continues to collect in your pipes. Difficult water ravages hot water heater, and without a softener, your utility bills will continue to barrel skyward. The perpetual cycle of repairs and replacements will continue until your home is protected by a water softener if your water supply is hard.</p>
