<p>When compared to gas models, electrical designs are simpler and more economical to install as electrical power is currently readily available through the main power supply line.

<p>lowered pressure principle assemblies: These are commonly used in industrial plants, hospitals, morgues, chemical plants, irrigation systems, boilers, and fire lawn sprinkler.
