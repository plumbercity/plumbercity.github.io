<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater at Kailua HI 96734</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these aspects are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
