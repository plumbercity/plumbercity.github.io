<p>Every day, the drains in your home successfully eliminate big amounts of water and waste. With time, dirt, debris, hair, and countless other little particles can get trapped and build up in your pipes.

<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals say, doesn't the water pressure in the water supply keep the irrigation water from going backwards? Yes, the majority of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a regular event, but it does take place more frequently than you think! Often it takes place during the night when you don't notice the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or connect a new pipe. This makes building and construction projects easily the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common cause of backflow. Fire engine utilize substantial pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Eliminate all parts of the disposer set from package, and organize the contents. Remove the P-trap and existing drain basket assembly carefully from the sink (Images 1 and 2).
