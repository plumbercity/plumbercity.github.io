Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
