<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits build up, until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits occur more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks, it's time for a new one.</p>
