<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
