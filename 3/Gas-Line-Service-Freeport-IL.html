<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize as soon as backwashing is total. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
