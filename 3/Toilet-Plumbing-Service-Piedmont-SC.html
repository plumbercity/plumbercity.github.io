<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and guaranteed and satisfy our stiff trust certification standards.

Damaged and wore away parts make repairs difficult and pricey, implying a faucet installation is more beneficial. Repairs are the proper fix for issues such as missing or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small components of the whole fixture. If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we suggest a new faucet installation.</p>

<h3>How To Deal With A Plumbing Emergency Piedmont SC</h3>
<p>A recently set up water heater should not produce unusual sounds, but it will begin to generate rumbling noises as it ages. The sounds get louder over time as the heater goes to warm the water. Things worsen drastically for families with a high demand for warm water. The factors for the noises can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which must be flushed to restore normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has actually been flushed, a water heater replacement may be necessary.</p>
<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and an excellent person. He told me exactly what to expect (cost, time, process) up front and provided as promised. I will absolutely use Clog Dawg once again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These prices are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay might be higher.</p>
