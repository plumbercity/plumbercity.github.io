<h3>Blocked Sewer in Cambridge MN 55008 - Some Vital Info You Should Know</h3>
<p>If your old disposal is broken beyond repair, you'll need to replace it.

Depending upon the pro you work with, it can be as much as half the price.</p>

<p>The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, however it doesn't grind up food, this indicates the flywheel is stuck. Attempt freeing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the proper size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>To eliminate the smells, first try putting BioSmart (readily available at WJ McNabb Plumbing) down your drain. You can likewise try 1 cup lemon juice down the drain. After a couple of minutes, run warm water down the drain. Inadequate or inaccessible cleanouts: No matter how efficient a drainage system is, it will likely get clogged at some point.
