<h3>Shower Repairs in Woodstown NJ 08098 - The Processes Involved</h3>
<p>Water that has been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been gotten rid of-- destructive. For this reason, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this type of corrosion A softener is simply capturing some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations while doing so (generally sodium or often potassium).</p>
