Some elements may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An important thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is a very important part of the design of each part. If the part is not repaired properly, the guide might limit the movement (instead of direct or steady) of the component, which might cause the part to not work to its abilities.
