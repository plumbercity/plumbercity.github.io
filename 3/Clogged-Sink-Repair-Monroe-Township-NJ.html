If it isn't, you'll need to either choose a smaller disposer, or customize the plumbing to accommodate the new setup. Foul odors. A functional sewer line should always be sealed airtight, indicating no water or gas need to ever leak out. If nevertheless, you begin smelling something foul coming out of your drains or around your house, there might be a fracture someplace in your sewer line.</p>

Some even prefer silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to remove.</p>
<p>It doesn't necessarily mean they need to be replaced if your pipes are older than these standards.
