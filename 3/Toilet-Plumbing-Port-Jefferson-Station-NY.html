<h3>Is Your Water Heater Leaking? Find Out What You Should Do in Port Jefferson Station NY 11776</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must first consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these elements are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>
