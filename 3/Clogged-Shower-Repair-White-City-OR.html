<p>When the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair procedure. It is essential that the plumbing system be turned on extremely gradually to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system need to be checked to make sure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close appropriately when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are totally open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
