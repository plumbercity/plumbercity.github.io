<p>Prior to selection and installation, refer to producers literature for temperature level ranges. All assemblies need to be protected from freezing temperatures and if set up where temperature levels will reach 100 degrees F or above, a hot water type assembly need to be used. Consult producers specs for recommendations.

<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

This type of valve is generally seen on lawn sprinkler systems or fire lawn sprinkler. There is a ball valve or gate valve assembled on each end. This permits isolation and testing.

<p>The discharge tube consisted of in the disposer package will be connected to the disposer utilizing the plate, gasket and screws originally intended for the disposer discharge elbow. If your kit only consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The successive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can lead to incorrect drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you might have the ability to cut off its elbow and utilize the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
