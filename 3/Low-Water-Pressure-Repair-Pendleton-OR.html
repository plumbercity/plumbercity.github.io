<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
