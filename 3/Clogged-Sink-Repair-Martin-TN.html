<p>The U-shaped pipe underneath bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that people expect to see but seldom stop to think of. Another really essential reason to call a professional for gas line repair in Richmond is the threat of fire it poses. When gas leakages go neglected longer than they should, the gas builds up and something as small as an oven burner can burst the whole home into flames. That's not all, a gas leak fire likewise causes other gas-run appliances to explode such as clothing dryer, water ranges, heaters, and fireplaces.</p>
