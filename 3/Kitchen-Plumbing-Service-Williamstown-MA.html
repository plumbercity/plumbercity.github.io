It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the salt, or salt, is saved and blended with water. If you plan to drain  your automated dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1).

However, it is necessary to properly maintain your disposal. Be sure to run it every day to keep it clear of particles. Constantly run water before and after grinding. Do not press too much waste down the disposal at one time.</p>
