For instance, cleaning fluids might be drawn back from car cleans; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler might go into the drinking waterline; bacteria and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water system from air conditioning cooling towers; and chemicals from medical clinic's X-ray development may stream in reverse into the drinkable water system.
