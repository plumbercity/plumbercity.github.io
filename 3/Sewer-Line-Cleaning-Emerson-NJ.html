<p>Replacing your flapper might require a little different actions than we reveal (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an unusual flush valve, discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job. To find a suitable replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Shut off the water before eliminating the flapper.) You might not discover a similar match, but chances are you'll find among the very same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
