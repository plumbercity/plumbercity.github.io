<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's probably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>

The water streams through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
