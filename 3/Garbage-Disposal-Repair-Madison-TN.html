<h3>Need A Plumber Service Madison TN</h3>

<p>This article aims to attend to the common misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes rust This is not the case: a correctly set up water softener does not make the treated water more corrosive. Here are a few confusing facts that frequently lead individuals to this incorrect conclusion. First, naturally soft water is usually corrosive. For that reason, softened water must also be destructive, right? This is a fallacy because naturally soft water tends to be destructive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening causes neither of these conditions.</p>
