<p>Plastic pipe is in large usage for domestic supply of water and drain-waste-vent (DWV) pipe. Principal types include: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not end up being useful to make till 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. developed a method to plasticize PVC, making it easier to process. PVC pipe started to be made in the 1940s and was in broad usage for Drain-Waste-Vent piping during the restoration of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics producers in Western Europe and Japan started producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe. The method for producing cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) was also established in the 1950s. Plastic supply pipes have ended up being increasingly common, with a range of fittings and materials used.</p>
<p>Pro Suggestion: If you're going to be draining pipes a dishwasher through the unit, now is the best time to remove the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Utilize a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet until the plug is broken off; retrieve the little piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is also the ideal time to make the connections for a hardwired unit with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
