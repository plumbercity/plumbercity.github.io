<p>It's important to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger a properly operating RPZ assembly to periodically release small amounts of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a big volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies should not be set up in areas subject to water damage. Adequate drainage must also be supplied.</p>

<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals say, does not the water pressure in the water supply keep the watering water from reversing? Yes, the majority of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a frequent incident, but it does occur more often than you believe! When you do not observe the water was off for a few minutes, typically it takes place at night. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or link a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction jobs quickly the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire battling is another common reason for backflow. Fire trucks use huge pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding areas.</p>
