<p>A review of the hydraulic conditions present at the assembly need to then be evaluated. There are hydraulic conditions such as pressure fluctuations and disc compression that might lead to false data on the functions of the backflow prevention assembly. Hydraulic conditions such as water hammer can cause extreme pressure spikes that could harm elements. The impacts of raised temperature can also trigger excessive pressure conditions which could harm the parts in the elements. These and other negative effects from the hydraulic conditions need to be recognized and their cause remedied. The brand-new parts can quickly be made inoperative if parts are replaced and the hydraulic conditions are not corrected.</p>
