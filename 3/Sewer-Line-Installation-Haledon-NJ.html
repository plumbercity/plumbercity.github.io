<p>Leak detection is a component of water conservation that relies on extremely technical know-how and specific equipment to recognize the location of leaks throughout the city's water distribution system and determine the location of those leaks at which noticeable water may or might not have surfaced. Water temperature issues can be repaired by adjusting the temperature on the water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet may be caused by a blocked aerator screen. Property owners can merely unscrew the aerator screen from the faucet to clear out minerals or other deposits. If the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way, water pressure can also be low.</p>

<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems normally are set up in locations where water might cause catastrophic damage, such as in freezers, computer rooms, and areas with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>

<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these components are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new sodium ions.</p>
