<h3>24 Hour Plumber & Water Heater Services Pensacola FL</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself project. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
