<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back against the required instructions of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the sprinkler system can become infected. There is potential for the infected water to become a health danger if enabled to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected routinely for efficiency, as well as checked yearly by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
