<p>You depend on your drains to bring wastewater from your tub, shower or sink. With time, the drains end up being clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more.

<p>In some neighborhoods, house water softeners drain to municipal wastewater treatment plants, which are not created to get rid of chloride.

<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound potable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common kind of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits collect, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes.

You might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up if you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the problem prior to you replace it. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs.</p>
