<p>Pictures provided by the American Backflow Prevention Association. The cost to repipe a house with copper pipe is between $8,000 and $16,000 or about $3 to $8 per linear foot. Replacing galvanized drain, waste, and vent pipe with copper expenses $13 to $15 per linear foot. Copper pipe is more costly than PEX, but it has some exceptional benefits. There are numerous elements within a toilet tank, and a few of them can make a toilet bowl not flush. Appropriate toilet repair can have the toilet flush like new once again.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes without any neighboring energies or obstructions, digging through and changing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or walkways, dig-free pipe lining might save you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a bucket under the P-trap and detach the drains. Then remove the sink strainer. Get rid of any excess putty.</p>
