Replacing galvanized drain, waste, and vent pipe with copper expenses $13 to $15 per linear foot. Copper pipe is more costly than PEX, but it has some exceptional benefits. There are numerous elements within a toilet tank, and a few of them can make a toilet bowl not flush. Appropriate toilet repair can have the toilet flush like new once again.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes without any neighboring energies or obstructions, digging through and changing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally.

Set a bucket under the P-trap and detach the drains. Then remove the sink strainer. Get rid of any excess putty.</p>
