<p>No warm water-- The lack of warm water is the biggest sign that there is something wrong with your San Antonio hot water heater. You may have sediment that has constructed up in the unit and separated the water from the heat source if you aren't getting sufficient hot water for your shower. If your hot water heater isn't doing its only task, it's time to speak with the specialists.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a flexible water supply line. They're a lot easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Be sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For an excellent seal, hold the hose so it intends directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the ports. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can actually trigger leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If needed, examine for leakages and tighten them a bit more.</p>
