Dealing with fixing a burst pipe is definitely not worth the cost savings sustained from utilizing a chemical drain cleaner.</p>
<p>This short article aims to attend to the common misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes deterioration This is not the case: a correctly configured water softener does not make the cured water more destructive. Here are a few complicated realities that frequently lead individuals to this erroneous conclusion. First, naturally soft water is normally destructive. Therefore, softened water must also be destructive, right? This is a misconception because naturally soft water tends to be destructive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening triggers neither of these conditions.</p>
