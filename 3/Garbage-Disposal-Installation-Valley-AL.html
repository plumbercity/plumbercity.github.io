<p>Water softeners include value to your operation by protecting your water-using devices from bad efficiency and early failure. Some tough water problems are very noticeable, like dispensers and sprayers ending up being clogged. Other problems can go unnoticed, like scale on water heater elements and buildup in reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Noticeable or invisible, these problems have genuine costs connected with them. Clogged fixtures cause replacement or reconditioning expenses and can annoy your clients. Scale buildup in your water heater will inflate your energy costs, and prematurely damaged RO membranes will leave you with unneeded replacement expenses. Quickly, these small costs can add up to make a genuine effect on your bottom line.</p>
<p>Water softening refers to the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular technique of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another kind of ion-- usually salt. The outcome is water that's been efficiently softened by removing nearly all traces of the minerals that constitute hard water.</p>
