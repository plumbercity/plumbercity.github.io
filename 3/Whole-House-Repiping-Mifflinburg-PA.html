<p>The cost of having your backflow preventer examined differs based on your place and the companies you may choose from.

<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years old and you have to work with a plumber for that burner kit. The total repair costs might be in the $300 range. A gas water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Opt for the brand-new heater.</p>
