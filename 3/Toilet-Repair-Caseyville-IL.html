<p>All of the drains in your house, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then exit into the sewer or septic tank from your home. Then that usually indicates that your main sewer line is backing up when you experience blockages in multiple drains at once in your home. This can happen in multiple places and any combination of drains. For instance, water might fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are several mixes of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and once you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from multiple drain lines in your home.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits accumulate, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits occur more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned if you want to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs.</p>
