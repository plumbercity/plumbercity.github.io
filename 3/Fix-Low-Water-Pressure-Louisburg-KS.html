<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite sensible. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>

<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are a lot of other small toilet parts that need to likewise be well preserved to help avoid leakages and other toilet difficulties. For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to crack and solidify or just be so squished that it doesn't fill the area in addition to it used to, and you end up with water all over the location. Just like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl washers and bolts can become rusty or so worn that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly recommend also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make certain everything is in tip-top shape.</p>
