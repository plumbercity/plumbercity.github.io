<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends on the level of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
