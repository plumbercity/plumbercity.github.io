<p>You discover rust in your water: If you begin to discover rust in your water, it could be an indication that you need pipe repair or drain repair services. Rust frequently seeps into the water system when pipes have ended up being rusty. Although rust isn't naturally unsafe for your health, it can be an indicator of trouble to come.

This piece of equipment is the center of controversy with lots of backflow authorities and need to never be confused with Double Check Valves. Consult local authorities for needed installation, as many do not recognize these as backflow prevention gadgets.</p>
