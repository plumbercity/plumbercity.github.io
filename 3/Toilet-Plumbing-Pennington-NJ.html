<p>The key to the technology is being able to manage both the crystal growth rate and their removal from our polymer beads, thereby getting rid of hardness ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not need replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," specified Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief technology officer. This technology is more cost reliable and lasts longer than common water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>Leaks- Do not spend for hot water you're not enjoying! Our plumbers will find any leakages and correctly seal them. 4 - The regrowth solution (CO2-enriched water) streams from the regeneration storage tank (4) to the exchanger filter.
