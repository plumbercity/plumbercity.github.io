The age of your water heater. A standard tank water heater generally lasts anywhere from 8-12 years before needing a replacement, while a tankless hot water heater can last approximately 20 with correct maintenance and care.

<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on specific brand-new sinks, but these will be identified to that effect. If you can't use plumber's putty, utilize a non-water-based silicone. Excess putty will squeeze out in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in place. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>
