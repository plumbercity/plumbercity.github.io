<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not recede versus the needed direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can become polluted. If enabled to re-enter the water supply, there is potential for the contaminated water to end up being a health danger. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined routinely for efficiency, along with inspected annually by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>

<p>Please let EBMUD know of any situation that may require a backflow device. Sometimes conditions on residential or commercial properties change that might require a backflow device, such as dealing with a boiler with additives or setting up a well with a pump. Sewer repairs are more than an inconvenience for your service, they can cause financial losses and in some circumstances can stop your company entirely. For dining establishments having a drain back up or a sewer line break can be disastrous. Even in a little office the concerns brought on by even small drain problems can trigger major issues.</p>
<p>Within commercial centers, DCV and RPZ backflow prevention systems must be examined, preserved, and tested with regularity. Without constant testing and maintenance, these systems can permit infected water to flow freely within your supply pipes, creating a severe health danger to developing occupants. Each backflow prevention system requires different testing procedures and intervals, and needs substantial experience and understanding.</p>
