<p>Your sewer line is one of the most important parts of your household plumbing - and if it ends up being broken or clogged, it could wreak undesirable problems on your home. A home's service line (likewise referred to as a sewer lateral) runs from your home to the mainline sewer in the street. In many cases, the homeowner is accountable for maintaining the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is responsible for maintaining the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
