They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, due to the fact that the heatpump is on top of the hot water heater. Likewise, hybrids need up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to record adequate heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to discharge the condensate.</p>
