Although you can't see into these drains, cleaning them resembles a process utilized to clear debris from the side gutter pipes on your home.</p>

When these aspects are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
