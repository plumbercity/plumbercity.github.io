<p>For gas lines that must be run under ground, an unique kind of black pipe should be utilized that is covered with an unique plastic product that keeps the wetness out.

Linking watering to water fountains, swimming pools and garden ponds forbade: State law and City regulation hold that no watering system might be connected to a fountain, swimming pool, or garden pond. These water features might only be filled with potable water. Water which has actually entered a watering system is not potable.</p>
<p>Water fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water functions should have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. If backflows take place from them, these water features are considered a health risk. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and place should be indicated on construction strategies. Any backflow preventer set up on a fountain or garden pond need to be checked upon installation and then each year.</p>
