Get it fixed as soon as you can if you observe a leak. Connecting watering to fountains, pool and garden ponds forbade: State law and City ordinance hold that no watering system may be linked to a fountain, swimming pool, or garden pond.

The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize as soon as backwashing is total. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
