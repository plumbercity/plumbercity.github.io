<p>If there are any lead pipes in the home, find out. Houses that were constructed prior to 1986 frequently have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how beneficial, is an environmental contaminant (note the need for unleaded fuel and paint in homes that is not lead based). If you have children, you might not wish to live in a home that has lead pipes.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual service is to have the defective pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is a choice to think about if you live in an older home - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for lots of decades, but steel ultimately suffers from deterioration and lacks the resilience these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
