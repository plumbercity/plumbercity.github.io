<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service Newport WA</h3>
<p>Though water line replacement seems like your house's equivalent of significant surgery, it's really something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with regularly. When your water lines are repiped, it simply indicates old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We find that homes 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. If you have an older house and are experiencing major and regular leaks, you might be in need of water line repiping. If you do have regular leaks, we find that repiping can in fact be the cheaper and better long-lasting option.</p>

When the supply of water system pressure dropped due to repair work, the chlordane was drawn back through your house into the water supply.</p>
