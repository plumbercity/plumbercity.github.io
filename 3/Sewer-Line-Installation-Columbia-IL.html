<p>Your house's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not actually the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>
<p>From underneath the sink, place a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Protect the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring. Next, ensure the drain compression seal is seated correctly in the drain locknut, then tighten the drain and reinstall locknut. Lastly, switch on the water and test for leaks.</p>
