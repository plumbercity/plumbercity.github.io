<p>Need loads, no matter what their usage, must be satisfied by a properly sized supply of water, which makes up the 2nd significant element of a water supply system. With adequate tank capability to fulfill variable peak load demand, the supply of water source can provide a steady circulation of water. Throughout hours of low need, the water circulation can be used to fill up storage cisterns, tanks and towers, which then provide water for emergency use and periods when need exceeds the baseline pumping rate. A water supply source can take many types, consisting of groundwater extraction well fields, free-flowing rivers, natural or man-made ponds, artesian springs, ocean water desalination plants, and rainwater run-off collection systems.</p>
<p>Imagine living in a house with soft water-- a home where you don't have unusual films on your dishes or mirrors, can lather soap easily, and don't need to stress over scaling on the inside or outside of your appliances. Sounds nice, does not it? What if we told you that you could do all of that with a tankless, saltless water softener? Well, with NuvoH2O environmentally friendly water systems for houses, you can.</p>
