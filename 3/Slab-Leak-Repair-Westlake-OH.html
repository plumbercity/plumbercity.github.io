<p>In water system systems, water is typically maintained at a considerable pressure to allow water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may be or fail reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an unexpectedly high need on the water supply (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe may enable infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>A few of the causes of drain line clogs in kitchen drains are years of drain build-up, a stopping working waste disposal unit, or too much food being disposed down the drain.
