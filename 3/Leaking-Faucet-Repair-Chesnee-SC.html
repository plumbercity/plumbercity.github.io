<p>Leaky faucets and clogged drains are the most typical sink repair problems. Common enough that lots of people go for diy repairs. However in some cases even identifying the leak can be a problem. It might be the shutoff valve, the faucet, a spray hose, garbage disposal fittings, the edge of the sink itself, or any part of the drain-- tailpiece, extension tube, slip extension, elbows, T joints, or the U or J trap.</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like material covered with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>The kitchen drain can quickly get clogged when mass quantities of food are launched into the garbage disposal.
