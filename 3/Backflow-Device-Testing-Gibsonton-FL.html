<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems generally are set up in areas where water could cause devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer rooms, and areas with electronic equipment.

Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>

<h3>When To Call A Plumber Gibsonton FL</h3>
<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic deterioration Direct contact between dissimilar metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced because of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
