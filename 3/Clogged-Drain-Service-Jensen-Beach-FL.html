<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product coated with favorably charged salt ions.

The water flows through the unit while the resin launches its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes with no close-by utilities or obstructions, digging through and changing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally.
