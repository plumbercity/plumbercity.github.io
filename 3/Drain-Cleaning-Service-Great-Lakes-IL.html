<p>The LAGBC is based on the 2013 California Green Building Standards Code, commonly called "CALGreen" that was developed and mandated by the State to achieve consistency amongst the numerous jurisdictions within the State; lower the building's energy and water usage; minimize waste; and decrease the carbon footprint. Continuous feed disposals are simple to run: you run water in the kitchen sink, turn a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this type of garbage disposal, however, bottle caps, silverware, and other metal debris can often get captured in the blades. This can damage the blades and require repairs.</p>
<p>When it comes to plumbing and maintenance, sewer video inspection is among the best ways to stay ahead of the video game.
