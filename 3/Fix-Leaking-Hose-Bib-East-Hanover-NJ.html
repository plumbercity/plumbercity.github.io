<p>Once you have actually discovered the journey lever you desire, all you really need to do is (CAREFULLY!) remove your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your brand-new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Remember that since of the way a lever works, the locknuts for most toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the appropriate way. When you have actually protected the journey lever and are prepared to hook up your flapper, make certain you have actually got just enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you push down on the journey lever.</p>
