<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal solution is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an option to think about if you reside in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for many decades, however steel eventually experiences corrosion and does not have the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
