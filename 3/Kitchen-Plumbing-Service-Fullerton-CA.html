<h3>Best Gas Tankless Water Heater - Indoor Vs. Outdoor Installation in Fullerton CA 92833</h3>
<p>I bought a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed price quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, since I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months earlier. I feel that rates were increased due to the fact that I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March stated depending upon the market and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
<p>Water fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water functions should have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. These water features are thought about a health danger if backflows happen from them. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and area need to be shown on construction plans. Any backflow preventer installed on a fountain or garden pond should be tested upon installation and after that annually.</p>
