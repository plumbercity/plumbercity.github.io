<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
