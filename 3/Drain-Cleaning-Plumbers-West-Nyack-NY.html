<h3>Faucet Problems That Need Faucet Replacement in West Nyack NY 10994</h3>
<p>I bought a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, because I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months earlier. I feel that prices were increased because I had a "Deal". An Angie's list short article from March said depending upon the market and severity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
