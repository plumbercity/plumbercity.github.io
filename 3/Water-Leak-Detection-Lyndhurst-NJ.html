The majority of the Valley in truth has some of the worst water in the country. We rank 3rd for the outright worst water in the nation according to DailyFinance and the Environmental Working Group. Having bad water comes naturally, we do reside in a desert after all. In truth the water you shower with, brush your teeth, and even consume has a chlorine level that is perfect for swimming pools. We have 300% more chemicals that exceed national health guidelines, and a even high portion of contaminants in our water that the nationwide average. On top of that our average water solidity level is between 18-23 grains per gallon of water or for simplicity factors "very tough water".</p>
