    <meta name="description" content="Plumbing Service Caruthersville Missouri - Water and electricity use are minimal (according to InSinkerator, disposers account for less than 1 percent of a household's daily water usage, and the total energy cost is about $0.50 per year); the devices don't require much maintenance and often last a decade or more; clogged pipes are rare because scraps are entirely pulverized; almost everything can go down the disposer (veggies, fruit, meat, pizza), and newer models are nearly silent (and not deadly).">
