Deterioration can actually consume a metal away causing the metal to not be as strong as it originally was or modify the tolerances causing parts to not operate in a backflow preventer. The impact of corrosion on a metal alloy must be assessed to figure out if the part is functional or must be changed.</p>

Without constant testing and maintenance, these systems can permit polluted water to stream freely within your supply pipes, creating a severe health risk to developing occupants. Each backflow prevention system needs different testing treatments and intervals, and needs substantial experience and knowledge.</p>
