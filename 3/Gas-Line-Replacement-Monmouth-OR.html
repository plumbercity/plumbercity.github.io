<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when looking for a practical service, especially when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous downsides to using these hazardous items - not least of which is that they typically consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a clog, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the threat of damage to your house and family.</p>
