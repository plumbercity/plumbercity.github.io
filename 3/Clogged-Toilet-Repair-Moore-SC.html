<p>Changing your flapper might require a little different steps than we reveal (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task if you have an unusual flush valve. To discover an ideal replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Switch off the water before eliminating the flapper.) You may not find an identical match, but possibilities are you'll find among the same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>

<h3>Water Heater Installation and Repair Tips in Moore SC 29369</h3>

<p>Polybutylene used inside your home can be discovered near the water heater or coming out of the walls to feed toilets or sinks. Caution: some plumbers installed stub outs" of copper when leaving the wall. Since copper is revealing does not imply you do not have polybutylene pipes, simply.

<p>You can use a wire coat wall mount by aligning it if you do not have a plumber's snake. Of course, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it might be long enough to reach some blockages.
