Here's how to assess your plumbing system and know when it's time for replacement.</p>
<p>Physical strength. Steamfitters, plumbers, and pipefitters must be able to raise and move heavy tools and products. Idea: Place a heavy object such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving throughout installation. Loosen up the clamp and eliminate the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal.

Most of the times, repiping is your only feasible option.</p>
