<p>When compared to gas models, electric designs are simpler and cheaper to install as electricity is already available through the main power supply line. For gas water heaters, a specific gas line needs to be installed and a practical source of gas established. Another function of an electrical water heater is that they do not need any ventilation. Gas models need to be aerated properly using vents and ducts in order to operate properly. With electric designs, you will not need to install any brand-new vents or ducts in your house.</p>
<p>If additional renovations are desired, such as setting up a tankless water heater or expanding the water system to accommodate a remodel, this is when those extra changes will be made.
