<p>Often you have to replace a sink-- when an enamel sink is badly damaged, or when any sink is leaking. And often you're just all set for a kitchen update. If you want several sinks in your house to  have soft water for easier dish washing, under-sink and counter top softeners can assist.

<p>Pro Tip: If you're going to be draining pipes a dishwasher through the system, now is the very best time to remove the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Utilize a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet up until the plug is broken off; obtain the little piece of plastic from inside the disposer.
