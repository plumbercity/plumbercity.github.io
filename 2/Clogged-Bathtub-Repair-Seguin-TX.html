<p>Finally, the most complicated and advanced backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five independently operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other four. Throughout basic water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if expensive) device is best used in vital locations where cross contamination might be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
