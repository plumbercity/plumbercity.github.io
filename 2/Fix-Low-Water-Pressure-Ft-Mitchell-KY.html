<p>The secret to the technology is being able to manage both the crystal growth rate and their removal from our polymer beads, consequently eliminating hardness ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not require replacement chemicals or regrowth of active websites," stated Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief technology officer. This innovation is more cost reliable and lasts longer than typical water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
