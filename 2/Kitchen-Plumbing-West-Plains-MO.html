<p>Climatic Vacuum Breaker - Design GFAVB - The climatic vacuum breaker is one of the least pricey backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and are good for back siphonage only for non-health hazard or health hazard conditions. They need to be installed downstream from any shut off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on an irrigation system you must install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It should also be set up a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB makers, and some local officials, need that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet). Some towns do not permit the use of GFAVB's. These units will NOT avoid backflow pressure and can just secure against back siphonage.</p>
