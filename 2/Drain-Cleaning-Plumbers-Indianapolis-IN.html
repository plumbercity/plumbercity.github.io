<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming potable water supply. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
