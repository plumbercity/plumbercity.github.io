<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and insured and satisfy our rigid trust certification requirements. A good general rule is to replace faucets that show rust, rust, fractures, and otherwise deep damages. Run-down and wore away parts make repairs difficult and expensive, implying a faucet installation is more beneficial. Repairs are the right fix for issues such as missing or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small elements of the whole fixture. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we recommend a brand-new faucet installation.</p>
