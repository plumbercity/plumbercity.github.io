<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound drinkable supply of water. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is very low.
