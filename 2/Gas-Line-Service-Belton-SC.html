<p>If you observe an odor or unpleasant smell originating from your unit, which is not uncommon, think about investing in a flange that can seal up and cover the top of the disposal, where foul smells can escape. These flanges are simple and widely readily available to install, costing around $30 at home enhancement or hardware stores. Switch off the water system to your home at the main line. To prevent leaks from springing during the installation procedure, turned off the water system to your home. Make sure your water heater's water supply is shut off, as is the electricity running to the unit.</p>
<p>Before installing, your professional will shut off water and electrical energy to the area. Next, the old sink flange is gotten rid of and cleaned up of any putty residue. Then, a brand-new mounting ring is installed to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is connected, and the disposal is connected to its mount.
