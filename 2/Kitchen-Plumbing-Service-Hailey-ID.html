If your house is over 50 years old, it's an excellent bet it's time to replace the plumbing, at a minimum cost of $2,000 and a maximum of $15,000.

<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years of ages and you need to employ a plumber for that burner package. The overall repair costs might be in the $300 range.
