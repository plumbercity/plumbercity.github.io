<p>Loose flanges are typically the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends upon the extent of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>

<p>Seattle Public Utilities checks backflow assemblies upon installation and carries out periodic re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies need to be evaluated by a State of Washington certified backflow assembly tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report need to be supplied to us. Get cleaner clothes, remove rust spots, and utilize less detergent when you soften your laundry water. Whole-house models are suitable for washing machines, or you can attempt laundry additive water softening products.</p>
<p>Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water features need to have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. These water functions are thought about a health danger if backflows happen from them. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and location need to be shown on construction plans. Any backflow preventer set up on a fountain or garden pond need to be evaluated upon installation and after that yearly.</p>
