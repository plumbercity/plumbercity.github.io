Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another appointment, they called him back and he said he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>

<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a versatile supply of water line. They're a lot much easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For a good seal, hold the hose so it aims straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the connectors.
