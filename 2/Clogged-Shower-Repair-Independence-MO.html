<h3>Tankless Water Heater in Independence Missouri</h2>
<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water technology start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, announced today they have actually accomplished a breakthrough in water softening treatment using an exclusive Surface Accelerated Condensation (SACr) innovation.
