<p>As soon as you have actually found the trip lever you want, all you actually need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) remove your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new journey lever, location it in the hole where your old trip lever was and protect it. Bear in mind that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the right way. When you've protected the trip lever and are prepared to hook up your flapper, ensure you have actually got just enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the method when you push down on the trip lever.</p>
