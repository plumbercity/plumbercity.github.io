Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line.
