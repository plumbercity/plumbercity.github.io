<p>Seattle Public Utilities inspects backflow assemblies upon installation and conducts routine re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies must be checked by a State of Washington certified backflow assembly tester prior to taking into service. A copy of the test report must be supplied to us. Get cleaner clothes, remove rust areas, and use less detergent when you soften your laundry water. Whole-house models are suitable for washing machines, or you can attempt laundry additive water softening items.</p>
<p>In fact, reverse flow testing designed to ensure that backflow preventers prevent backflow was removed from NFPA 25 in 2011. While NFPA recognizes that backflow remains a legitimate health issue, it thinks about preventing it outside the scope of NFPA 25. Rather, NFPA presumes that local or state requirements will ensure that backflow preventers are appropriately evaluated by qualified workers.</p>
<p>Please let EBMUD know of any situation that might require a backflow device. Often conditions on homes change that might need a backflow device, such as treating a boiler with ingredients or setting up a well with a pump. Sewer repairs are more than a hassle for your organisation, they can trigger financial losses and in some circumstances can stop your organisation entirely. For restaurants having a drain back up or a sewer line break can be catastrophic. Even in a small office the concerns caused by even small drain problems can trigger major problems.</p>
