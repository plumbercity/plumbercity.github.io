<p>Here at High 5 Plumbing, our Denver drain cleaning group is happy to utilize Bio-Clean items for every single drain-cleaning job. Bio-Clean is a natural service that's both harmless to your plumbing and extremely reliable at removing gunk, waste, and organic product that so frequently clogs up your drain lines. Caustic drain cleaners run along the bottom of your pipes, corroding the sidewalls and only partially fixing the problem. Bio-Clean is a service of live germs that actively look for natural material and eat away at it, creating safe byproducts of carbon dioxide, water, and mineral ash, all of which are easily dealt with at local sewage plants.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems usually are installed in big, unheated locations, such as parking lot. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler triggers due to heat, the air is released, enabling the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to reduce the fire.</p>
