<p>When you rely on Roto-Rooter for water heater repair, replacement or maintenance, you can expect professional service from knowledgeable plumbing specialists. Backflow prevention devices operate by permitting water to stream in only one direction. In an unprotected water service connection, potable water can flow both in and out of a building or fixture. When water service is interrupted in the street or in a structure for any reason, there is a pressure drop which can draw polluted water in reverse into the water system. For example, cleaning fluids might be drawn back from cars and truck cleans; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler might get in the drinking waterline; bacteria and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water system from a/c cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray development might flow in reverse into the drinkable water supply.

Scale deposits also accumulate to plug plumbing components and develop in other home appliances such as coffee pots and dishwashing machines, thus impacting their performance.</p>
