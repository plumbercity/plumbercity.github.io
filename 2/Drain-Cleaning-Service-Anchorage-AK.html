For this reason, WQA advises that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this type of deterioration A softener is simply recording some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (generally salt or often potassium).</p>
