When water service is interrupted in the street or in a structure for any factor, there is a pressure drop which can draw infected water in reverse into the water supply. For example, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from automobile washes; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler may go into the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water supply from cooling cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray development might stream in reverse into the safe and clean water system.

<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly imagined. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
