<h3>Sewer Cleaners in Laguna Niguel California</h2>
<p>In some communities, house water softeners drain to municipal wastewater treatment plants, which are not developed to get rid of chloride. The chloride travels through the treatment plant and ends up in our lakes and streams. In homes with personal wells and house softeners, chloride drains to the house's septic tank and after that ends up in lakes and streams.</p>
<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another appointment, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>
