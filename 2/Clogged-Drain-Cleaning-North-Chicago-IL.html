<h3>Things To Consider Before Hiring A Plumber North Chicago IL</h3>
<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back versus the required direction of flow. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the lawn sprinkler can become contaminated. There is capacity for the polluted water to end up being a health danger if enabled to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for effectiveness, along with inspected annually by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
