Water solidity, measured by the grains per gallon (gpg) of magnesium and calcium in the water, varies throughout the U.S. from slightly hard (<3 gpg) to very hard (>14 gpg).</p>
<p>Stegle states that when they are dealing with a client on a custom home, they will work directly with the homeowner when it comes to choosing faucets and other components. As a subcontractor, those choices might have currently been made.

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like material coated with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the unit while the resin launches its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
