This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- destructive. For this reason, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this kind of corrosion A softener is merely recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations at the same time (normally sodium or often potassium).</p>
