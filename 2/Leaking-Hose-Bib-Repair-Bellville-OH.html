<p>A freshly installed hot water heater should not produce unusual sounds, but it will start to create rumbling sounds as it ages. The noises get louder over time as the heater goes to warm the water. Things get worse dramatically for households with a high need for hot water. The factors for the sounds can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which need to be flushed to restore normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has been flushed, a water heater replacement may be essential.</p>
