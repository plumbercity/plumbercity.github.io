If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>

If your set just consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not advised - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint. The successive 90 ° turns in such a setup can lead to improper drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you may be able to cut off its elbow and utilize the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
