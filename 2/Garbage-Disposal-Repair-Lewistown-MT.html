<p>Hellenbrand water softeners and conditioners eliminate calcium and magnesium from your water, leaving it softer and cleaner. Put simply, soft water conserves you money. Reduced Pressure Backflow Prevention Assembly (RP): An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that consists of two separately acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve between the check valves and listed below the first check valve.</p>
<p>In reality, reverse flow testing designed to make sure that backflow preventers avoid backflow was gotten rid of from NFPA 25 in 2011. While NFPA acknowledges that backflow stays a genuine health issue, it considers preventing it outside the scope of NFPA 25. Rather, NFPA presumes that local or state requirements will guarantee that backflow preventers are properly tested by qualified workers.</p>
