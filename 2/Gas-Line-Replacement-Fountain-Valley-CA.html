<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Fountain Valley CA 92708</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these components are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
