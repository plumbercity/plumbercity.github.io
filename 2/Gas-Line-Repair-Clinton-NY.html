There can be numerous reasons someone is experiencing problems with their drains or sewer lines, and just a professional can use a proper diagnosis.

<p>Changing your flapper might need somewhat various actions than we reveal (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, discovering a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task. To discover an ideal replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Shut off the water prior to eliminating the flapper.) You may not discover a similar match, but chances are you'll find among the exact same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
