<p>A. Typically wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
