<p>Downspout Drains: These clog with leaves and debris and can stop working to bring water from roofing gutters far from your house or service when not properly kept. Even if you take great care of your drains by covering them and avoiding pouring any liquid fat, oil, and grease down them, often clogs are inevitable.

<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can easily cause countless dollars in water damage, disrupt your household for weeks, and throw your remodel way off schedule.
