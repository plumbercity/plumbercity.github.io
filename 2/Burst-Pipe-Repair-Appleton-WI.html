<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
