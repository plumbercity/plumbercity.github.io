<p>Hard water is brought on by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to eliminate these minerals. When the water can be found in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the service by the salt ions.</p>
<p>Though it's not always essential, often the plumber may have to repair or upgrade wiring to power the new waste disposal unit. This typically costs an extra $50 to $100+. The pilot burner might need to be relit, the gas line might be clogged or need repair. The flowers or plants near the gas leak will be tarnished or deteriorated if the gas line is harmed.
