<h3>Getting Blocked Sewer Drainage Solutions in Trinidad CO 81082</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should initially consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these components are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
