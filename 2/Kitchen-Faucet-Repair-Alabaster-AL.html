Rather of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not come back due to the fact that he had another appointment.
