<p>Spotty meals? Some underground gutter drains terminate in the sewer system instead of at the edge of your yard. In that case, step from the downspout to the closest manhole, and use an auger line at least that long to guarantee you're cleaning the entire pipe. A waste disposal unit will last 10 to 12-years, and the majority of service warranties cover the first 2 to 5-years. When purchasing a new system, keep this in mind.</p>
<p>When you have a problem with your toilet-- whether a clog that can't be fixed with simply a plunger, a leak, or a toilet that will not flush-- you need a plumber, quickly.
