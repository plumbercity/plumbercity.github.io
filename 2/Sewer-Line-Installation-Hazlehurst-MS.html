<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Seeking to repair or replace your garbage disposal? Lots of obstructions are brought on by putting excessive toilet tissue into the bowl. Be aware of how much toilet paper your toilet can efficiently rid the bowl of per flush. Never ever place any paper item into the toilet bowl other than toilet tissue. Paper towels can quickly block the toilet drain line or trigger a clog even more down the drainpipe. Feminine hygiene items should be disposed of in the garbage and never ever in the toilet.</p>
