<p>Have utilized Plumb Crazy on three various occasions, the last including a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our home. Billy and Hector were our specialists and they were wonderful. They quickly discovered the leak and fixed it without making a big mess.

<p>If you do not have a plumber's snake, you can utilize a wire coat wall mount by straightening it. Naturally, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it may be long enough to reach some blockages. If you can reach it, place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to press through or pull out the clog. Be careful not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
