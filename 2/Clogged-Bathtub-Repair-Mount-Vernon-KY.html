<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Mount Vernon KY</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed problem. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Not all toilet problems require the help of a professional. Some minor blockages can be looked after with a plunger and frequently, when the toilet will not stop running, it's a simple matter of changing the chain on the flapper valve inside the tank. Nevertheless, particular issues do require a qualified plumber, and it is essential to know the difference to prevent wasted time, aggravation, and cash.</p>
