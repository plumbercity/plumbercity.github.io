<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Dundee IL 60118?</h3>
<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been gotten rid of-- destructive. For this factor, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this kind of corrosion A softener is merely recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (generally sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
