Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
