<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made between the potable supply of water and non-potable water or substances a backflow assembly is required to be installed.

Make sure that the softener is filled with salt or potassium chloride following the manufacturer's suggestions.</p>
<p>Checking the water meter is a fantastic next action in your plumbing inspection. If the water meter is turning, close all faucets and inspect. There is a leak somewhere and this could be severe issue if it is. Move on to the valves. Start with the main shut off valve operation. When shut off, no faucet in your house should have water. This goes for every other shut down valve and their corresponding faucets. You are off to a great start if whatever is working correctly.</p>

<p>Replacing your flapper may need a little different steps than we show (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task if you have an unusual flush valve. To discover a suitable replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Switch off the water before eliminating the flapper.) You may not discover a similar match, but opportunities are you'll locate among the same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>

<p>When you have actually discovered the journey lever you want, all you actually need to do is (CAREFULLY!) eliminate your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your brand-new trip lever, location it in the hole where your old trip lever was and secure it. Bear in mind that since of the way a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the proper method. When you have actually secured the trip lever and are prepared to attach your flapper, make certain you've got just enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the method when you push down on the trip lever.</p>
