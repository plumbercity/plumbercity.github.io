<p>Backflow is bad news. After an inspection has been set up using the Permits and Inspections Online Permitting Service scheduling system, inspectors may be called in between 8:00 am - 9:00 am the day of the inspection. The inspectors will arrange their everyday work schedules and do not understand what inspections have been requested prior to the inspection date.</p>
<p>Our licensed plumbing service technicians can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by linking a hose to drain the tank to a suitable drain. Flushing the water heating tank must be done 2x every year.
