<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your home's equivalent of significant surgical treatment, it's in fact something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with regularly. When your water lines are repiped, it simply means old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with new pipes. We find that houses 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement. You could be in need of water line repiping if you have an older home and are experiencing regular and significant leakages. If you do have regular leaks, we find that repiping can really be the more affordable and better long-term option.</p>
<p>Tree roots can be a major factor in affected sewer lines. Tree roots grow in several directions and can get very large causing invasion of the lines underground.
