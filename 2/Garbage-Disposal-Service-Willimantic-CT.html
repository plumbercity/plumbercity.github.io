<h3>Plumbers And House Plumbing Willimantic CT</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's DIY project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>

However, there are numerous downsides to using these harmful items - not least of which is that they normally include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, however at the cost of providing the danger of damage to your home and household.</p>
