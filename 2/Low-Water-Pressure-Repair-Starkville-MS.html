<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite.

As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water streams through the unit while the resin releases its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
