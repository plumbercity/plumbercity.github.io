<p>Water softeners add value to your operation by protecting your water-using equipment from bad efficiency and premature failure. Some tough water problems are very visible, like sprayers and dispensers becoming clogged. Other problems can go undetected, like scale on water heater elements and buildup in reverse osmosis (RO) membranes.
