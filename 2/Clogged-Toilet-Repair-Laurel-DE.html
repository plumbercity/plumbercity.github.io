<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, a range of products were used for home plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most typical metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping. Although all these products are long lasting in the short-term, they degrade over decades. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are vulnerable to various kinds of rust. After about fifty years, they'll begin to damage from corrosion and may place toxins into the freshwater supply. We recommend replacing the iron, steel, and clay pipes in your house. This might not need entirely repiping your house, given that newer products might have currently been used in some areas, such as the bathroom plumbing. A professional plumber can help you identify precisely what work needs to be done.</p>
