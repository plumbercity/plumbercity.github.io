<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years of ages and you have to hire a plumber for that burner set. The overall repair costs might remain in the $300 range. A gas hot water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Go for the new heater.</p>

<p>Drawbacks to be aware of is that hybrid water heaters need to be installed in an area that remains between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heatpump is on top of the hot water heater. Also, hybrids need up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to record enough heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to discharge the condensate.</p>
<p>Hard water is brought on by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to eliminate these minerals. When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are changed in the service by the salt ions.</p>
