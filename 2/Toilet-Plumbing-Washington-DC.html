The preset number represents the quantity of time between each regrowth. For example, a lower selected number implies your softener will regenerate less often. If you are experiencing stains, try picking a lower number up until you find one that meets your needs. Demand-initiated softeners are more popular and effective than time-initiated softeners.</p>

After a few minutes, run warm water down the drain. Insufficient or unattainable cleanouts: No matter how reliable a drainage system is, it will likely get clogged eventually.
