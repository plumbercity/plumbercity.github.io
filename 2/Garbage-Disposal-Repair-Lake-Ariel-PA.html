Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
