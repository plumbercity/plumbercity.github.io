<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as hard water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals say, does not the water pressure in the water system keep the irrigation water from going backwards? Yes, most of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a frequent incident, however it does happen more frequently than you believe! When you do not observe the water was off for a few minutes, typically it takes place at night. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or link a new pipe. This makes building and construction projects easily the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common reason for backflow. Fire engine use huge pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This often triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding communities.</p>
