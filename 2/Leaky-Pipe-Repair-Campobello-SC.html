<p>Responsive flow innovation works by continuously bringing tanks online and off-line in reaction to the water demands of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow technology, only one of the 4 tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive design enables the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than traditional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
