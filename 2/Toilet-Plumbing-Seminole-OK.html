<p>Most houses or structures that were built in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather condition protection. As the external coating of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
