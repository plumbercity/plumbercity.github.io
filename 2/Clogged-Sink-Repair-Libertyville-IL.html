The temperature and pressure relief valve is a security device that restricts tank pressure and keeps it from blowing up (Photo 4). A brand-new one must be included with every installation.

<p>A cross-connection is any momentary or irreversible connection in between a public water supply or consumer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping between a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>A properly designed irrigation system is very important for the health of plants in a landscape but it's also essential for human health. An effective irrigation system keeps the water for landscapes separate from safe and clean drinking water, avoiding contamination that can cause diseases. That's why a backflow preventer is a requirement on any watering project.</p>
