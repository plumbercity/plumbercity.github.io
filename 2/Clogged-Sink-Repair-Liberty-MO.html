<p>The Required Inspections Table shown below lists those inspections that should be carried out to verify that your work complies with the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code. Please note that Virginia's Building regulations restricts using any plumbing fixtures or equipment prior to approval of all needed inspections. We hope this list is helpful to you throughout the course of your project. Please call our Structure Inspections Department, at 804-501-4360, if you have any concerns about what is required for each inspection or if you need aid scheduling an inspection. Building, Electrical, Mechanical or Fire Protection work need extra permits and inspections. Different notifications are available to explain the inspections needed for each type of authorization.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as hard water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
