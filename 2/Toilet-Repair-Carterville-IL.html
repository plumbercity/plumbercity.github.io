<p>Plastic pipe is in broad use for domestic water supply and drain-waste-vent (DWV) pipe. Principal types consist of: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not end up being practical to manufacture up until 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. established a method to plasticize PVC, making it much easier to process. PVC pipe began to be manufactured in the 1940s and remained in wide usage for Drain-Waste-Vent piping during the reconstruction of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics makers in Western Europe and Japan started producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe.

<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits build up, up until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes.

You could have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up if you want to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem prior to you replace it. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs.</p>
