This can trigger low circulation problems or even stop a fixture from streaming altogether. The next common problem that occurs with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which happens when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so serious that it lowers the readily available volume of water that can stream around the system.</p>
