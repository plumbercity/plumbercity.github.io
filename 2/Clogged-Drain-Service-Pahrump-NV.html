<p>Leaks are sneaky. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capacity to soften difficult water. Through a process called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, offering the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>

<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of two categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on an established schedule and then go back to service. Due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, usually regenerate after many gallons of water have been softened. Such designs are practical if you have a fluctuating water utilize schedule.</p>
