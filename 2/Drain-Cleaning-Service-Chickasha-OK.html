<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Fed Up With False Guarantees? Bad Smells - If foul smells are emerging from your drain, this is a clear indication your sink is not correctly draining pipes water.

<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends on the level of the rot.

Before you install this kind of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
