Unnoticeable or visible, these problems have actually genuine expenses connected with them. Clogged fixtures trigger replacement or refurbishing costs and can annoy your clients. Scale accumulation in your water heater will inflate your energy costs, and prematurely harmed RO membranes will leave you with unnecessary replacement expenses.
