<h3>The 5 Most Useful Tools For De-Clogging in Waynesville NC 28786</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written price quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, given that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months ago. I feel that costs were increased because I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March stated depending on the marketplace and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
<p>Looking for reliable, cost-efficient solutions to damaged pipes? Call (979) 200-6674 to find out how your local Brenham repiping professionals can help. You may have a leak someplace if you've been noticing a musty smell developing in the cabinets under the sink. It could be the drainpipe, the faucet, or perhaps the supply hose. Given that they are relatively easy to pinpoint, switch on the water and get sleuthing under your sink.</p>
