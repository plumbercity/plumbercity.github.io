When setting up the plumbing to your softener, take your time and guarantee your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated properly. If the bypass valve is split, it can also trigger the system to leak. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that may need to be re-lubricated or changed with time. A cracked rotor valve or rotor valve seal might also be the perpetrator. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system during softening and regeneration processes.
