For this reason, WQA advises that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this kind of deterioration A softener is merely catching some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (normally salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
