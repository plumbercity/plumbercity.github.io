<p>Many homes or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather defense. As the outer coating of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>This article intends to resolve the typical misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes corrosion This is not the case: an effectively set up water softener does not make the treated water more destructive.

For that reason, softened water must likewise be destructive, right? This is a fallacy because naturally soft water tends to be destructive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening causes neither of these conditions.</p>
