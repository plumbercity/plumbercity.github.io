Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity.
