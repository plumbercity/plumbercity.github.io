<p>Leak detection is a component of water preservation that depends on highly technical know-how and customized equipment to identify the place of leaks throughout the city's water distribution system and pinpoint the place of those leakages at which visible water may or may not have actually emerged. Water temperature problems can be repaired by adjusting the temperature on the water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet might be triggered by a blocked aerator screen.
