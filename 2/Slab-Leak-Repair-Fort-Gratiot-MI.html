Plumber's putty can not be used on certain new sinks, however these will be labeled to that result. If you can't utilize plumber's putty, use a non-water-based silicone. When you tighten the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out between the new basket strainer and the sink. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel.

<h3>Modern Water Leak Detection Technique in Fort Gratiot MI 48059</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, given that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months earlier. I feel that costs were increased due to the fact that I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March said depending upon the marketplace and intensity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
