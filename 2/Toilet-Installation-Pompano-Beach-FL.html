Kenny came out and did an incredible task unclogging my storm drain. He identified the problem and was able to return and jet it out. Saved me the time and money of ripping all of it out and replacing it. He offered suggestions to help in the future, was really professional, and will be utilized again if need be. Extremely recommended.</p>
<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer package will be attached to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally meant for the disposer discharge elbow. If your kit only includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not suggested - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint. The successive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can result in incorrect drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you might be able to cut off its elbow and utilize the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
