<p>Water softeners add value to your operation by safeguarding your water-using equipment from bad performance and premature failure. Some tough water problems are extremely visible, like dispensers and sprayers becoming clogged. Other problems can go undiscovered, like scale on water heater aspects and accumulation in reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Invisible or noticeable, these problems have genuine costs connected with them. Clogged components cause replacement or refurbishing costs and can frustrate your customers. Scale accumulation in your water heater will inflate your energy expenses, and too soon damaged RO membranes will leave you with unnecessary replacement expenses. Soon, these little costs can amount to make a genuine impact on your bottom line.</p>
