A gas leak can result in a fire, and even an explosion, or cause physical stress on the body that results in headaches, fatigue, dizziness, irritation to eyes and throat, chest pains, sounding in the ears, nosebleeds, and more.

<p>Leakages - If your water heater is leaking, you may need to replace the unit. In time leakages can trigger other problems and even cause mold to grow around the unit. Get it repaired as soon as you can if you notice a leak.
