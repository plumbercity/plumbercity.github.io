<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a practical service, specifically when easy plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of drawbacks to utilizing these hazardous items - not least of which is that they typically contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the risk of damage to your house and household.</p>
