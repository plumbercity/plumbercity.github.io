In many cases, the homeowner is responsible for preserving the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is responsible for maintaining the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>Toilet repair tends to freak the majority of people out a little, which is entirely easy to understand. No one wants to mistakenly break something that could flood their bathroom with raw sewage.
