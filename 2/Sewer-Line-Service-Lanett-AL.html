<p>As with kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your sink, shower, or bathtub) can be remedied easily if the clog is simple and shallow. For the majority of clogs you'll simply need a plunger, and in some cases some chemicals, however if this doesn't solve the problem then you may also have to contact a drain specialist like Reckon & Reckon to help. As a bathroom drain is also more difficult to repair and replace than a kitchen sink drain, it's more likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
