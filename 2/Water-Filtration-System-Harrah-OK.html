<p>You will be able to ask for the date and time of the inspection on the TSE permit application. The LADBS application must be filed and paid for at least two (2) company days prior to the date of the event, AND, after you have actually gotten all other needed approvals or clearances from all other agencies. Garbage disposals can be made of either aluminum or stainless steel. Aluminum is more economical but more prone to leaking and deterioration. Stainless steel blades are also more resilient. People with a septic tank will need to talk to the septic system installer or maker to discover which waste disposal unit models work with their system.</p>
<p>Specialized Salts: Various geographic areas have different water sources and mineral material. Diamond Crystal ® products deal with specific problems such as iron concentration, rust stains and salt content. Not sure whether you have a backflow prevention device set up? Typically, it's set up near your cooking stop and waste. David Davia is the Executive Vice President & CEO of the Colorado Association of Mechanical and Plumbing Contractors. He called several of his member contractors to discover what a reasonable and sensible  price would be for a garbage disposal install.</p>
<p>Find out if there are any lead pipes in the house. Houses that were built prior to 1986 often have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how beneficial, is an environmental contaminant (note the need for unleaded fuel and paint in homes that is not lead based). If you have kids, you might not wish to live in a house that has lead pipes.</p>
<p>Eliminate all parts of the disposer kit from package, and arrange the contents. Remove the P-trap and existing drain basket assembly thoroughly from the sink (Images 1 and 2). Place a big pan below the sink to capture water that might spill when you detach the drain, and keep a towel close by to tidy up spills.
