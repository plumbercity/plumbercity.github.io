Some components might have very tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An important thing to determine on each element is the guide.

If the component is not fixed properly, the guide could restrict the movement (instead of direct or constant) of the component, which could cause the part to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
