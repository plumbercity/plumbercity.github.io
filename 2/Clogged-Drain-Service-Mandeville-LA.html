<p>Run the hot water. Hot water is your good friend, particularly for your kitchen sink. Even if you are extremely mindful with what you put down your sinks, food remnants and cooking oils still leave down our drains - particularly the kitchen sink. Running the hot water after you've used your sink helps clear debris and break up food and oils and keep your drain clear.</p>
<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on certain new sinks, but these will be identified to that result. If you can't use plumber's putty, utilize a non-water-based silicone. Excess putty will squeeze out between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in location. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to insert the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>
