Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Generally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions.

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like material covered with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the system while the resin releases its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to get rid of osmotic pressure and remove water particles from the solution with solidity ions. The membrane has pores big enough to confess water molecules for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is without hardness ions without any other ions being added. Membranes are a type of water filter needing regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
