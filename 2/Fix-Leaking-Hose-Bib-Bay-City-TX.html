<h3>Plumbing And Remodeling Services Bay City TX</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>The Albuquerque Water Authority offers rebates for setting up low circulation toilets, urinals, and low circulation showerheads. High efficiency, low circulation toilets utilize 1.28 gallons per flush and urinals utilize much less water. Older toilets could be flushing approximately 5 gallons per flush!
