<p>Foul Sewer Smell: Among the very first most apparent signs of a sewer issue is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a basic problem such as a broken water seal, or it can suggest a larger concern such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can prevent severe damage to your home. Even if the issue originates with the community system, it's still clever to generate the specialists to limit the damage to your home.</p>
