<p>Leakages are sly. With time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capacity to soften tough water. Through a process called regeneration, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, providing the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
