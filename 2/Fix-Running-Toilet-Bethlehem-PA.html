<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
