They need to be installed downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. , if an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on an irrigation system you need to install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.. It should also be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local authorities, need that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the highest outlet).
