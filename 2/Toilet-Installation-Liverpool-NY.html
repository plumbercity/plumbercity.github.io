According to Sankarasubramanian et al., The mean per capita water use per day is higher in rural counties than urban counties in all the climate regions, except in the Central and Southeast areas"1 with rural areas having less effective supply of water systems2 primarily due to the relative absence of funds to upgrade and maintain their systems. So, the higher per capita usage" of water in backwoods may consist of considerable non-revenue water losses from their circulation pipelines.
