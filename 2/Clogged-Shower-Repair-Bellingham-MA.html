<p>Here at High 5 Plumbing, our Denver drain cleaning team is happy to use Bio-Clean items for every drain-cleaning job. Bio-Clean is a natural service that's both harmless to your plumbing and incredibly reliable at eliminating grime, waste, and natural product that so frequently clogs up your drain lines. Caustic drain cleaners run along the bottom of your pipes, rusting the sidewalls and just partly fixing the issue.
