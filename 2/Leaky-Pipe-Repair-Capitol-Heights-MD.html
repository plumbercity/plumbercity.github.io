They conserve energy by only heating the quantity of water required at a given moment.</p>

<p>Please let EBMUD know of any scenario that might require a backflow device. In some cases conditions on properties change that may require a backflow device, such as dealing with a boiler with additives or installing a well with a pump. Sewer repairs are more than an inconvenience for your company, they can cause monetary losses and in some instances can stop your business totally. For restaurants having a drain back up or a sewer line break can be disastrous. Even in a small office the problems triggered by even little drain problems can trigger major problems.</p>
<p>Stop work orders will be utilized to stop work that is identified to be contrary to arrangements of the Uniform Code, or is being performed in a unsafe or hazardous manner, or is being performed without obtaining a needed permit. A stop work order shall specify the reason for its issuance and the conditions which should be satisfied before work will be permitted to resume.</p>
