<p>Before selection and installation, refer to makers literature for temperature ranges. All assemblies need to be protected from freezing temperature levels and if set up where temperature levels will reach 100 degrees F or above, a warm water type assembly must be used. Consult manufacturers requirements for recommendations. When searching for plumbing services in the area, specify with your requirements and ask candidates if they are licensed plumbers and if they have the advanced experience and licenses connected with a plumbing contractor.</p>
