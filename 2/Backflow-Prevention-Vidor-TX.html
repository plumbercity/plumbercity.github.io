<p>In the 1990 â€² s, drought conditions inspired water suppliers to implement water conservation programs in California. In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet fixtures in homes were replaced with 1.6 - gallons per flush models.

Constant blockages suggest your toilet no longer has actually the power needed to successfully eliminate waste with each flush.</p>
