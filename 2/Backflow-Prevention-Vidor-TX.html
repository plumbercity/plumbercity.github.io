<p>In the 1990 ′ s, drought conditions inspired water suppliers to implement water conservation programs in California. In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet fixtures in homes were replaced with 1.6 - gallons per flush models. Continuous obstructions: If the plunger has actually become a routine component in your bathroom, it's time for a replacement. Constant blockages suggest your toilet no longer has actually the power needed to successfully eliminate waste with each flush.</p>
