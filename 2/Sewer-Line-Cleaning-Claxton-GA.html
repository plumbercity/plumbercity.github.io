The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is a very critical part of the style of each part. If the element is not fixed correctly, the guide might limit the motion (rather than direct or constant) of the element, which might trigger the element to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
