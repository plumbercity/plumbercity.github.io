<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Rye NY</h3>
<p>Many homes or structures that were constructed in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to rust. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to provide weather condition security. As the outer finishing of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>During regeneration, the water softener will take the salt water option into the softener tank and the ion exchange process happens again, only this time in reverse. At the time of inspection, make certain to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the whole system.
