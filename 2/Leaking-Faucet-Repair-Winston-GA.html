Although these property owners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was certainly good timing to camera the line prior to collapsing.

At the least, it would have been a really pricey option.</p>
<p>Once a large sufficient source of water has actually been recognized and assessed, the third significant component of a water system system enters play: a system of pipelines to convey the water from its source to its customers.

Typically constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe segments, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable finish, these are big underground and aboveground pipes designed to bring bulk flow amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and distribution nodes where the flows are transferred to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines.
