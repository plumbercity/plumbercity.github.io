<p>In some communities, home water softeners drain to local wastewater treatment plants, which are not designed to get rid of chloride. The chloride goes through the treatment plant and ends up in our streams and lakes. In houses with personal wells and home softeners, chloride drains to the home's septic tank and then winds up in lakes and streams.</p>
<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Photo 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on particular brand-new sinks, but these will be labeled to that result. Utilize a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. Excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in place. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to insert the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>
<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc connected to a climatic vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outdoors air. This activates the disc to open, enabling air to enter the valve and restore pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric standard. This repair of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
