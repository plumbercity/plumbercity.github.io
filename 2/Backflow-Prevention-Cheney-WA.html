When these elements are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
<p>Responsive flow technology works by constantly bringing tanks on-line and off-line in action to the water needs of your carwash.

Nevertheless, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill up. This responsive style allows the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than traditional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
