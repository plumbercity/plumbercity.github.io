<p>When compared to gas models, electric models are simpler and less expensive to install as electricity is currently offered through the main power supply line. For gas water heaters, a particular gas line needs to be installed and a feasible source of gas established. Another function of an electrical water heater is that they do not need any ventilation. Gas designs need to be aerated properly utilizing vents and ducts in order to function correctly. With electrical models, you will not have to install any brand-new vents or ducts in your home.</p>
