<h3>How To Install A Sand Trap Drain Pleasant Grove AL</h3>
<p>The use of different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic corrosion Direct contact between different metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two various types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced because of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
