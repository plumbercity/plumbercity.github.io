<p>If you have a garbage disposal, it is important that the system and garbage disposal plumbing remain in excellent working order to prevent kitchen drain blockages or backups.

Waste disposal unit blockages can be triggered by food products like fats or grease, bones, or extremely fibrous foods like celery.</p>
<p>Once you have actually found the trip lever you want, all you truly need to do is (CAREFULLY!) remove your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your brand-new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old trip lever was and secure it. Remember that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for most toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the proper way. When you have actually secured the trip lever and are ready to attach your flapper, ensure you've got just enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the method when you push down on the trip lever.</p>
