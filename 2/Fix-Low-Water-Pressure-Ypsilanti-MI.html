<p>We concentrate on storm drain inspections and cleaning. Many kitchen sink obstructions are because of heavy grease accumulation and food particles.

Explore our water softener collection and enjoy much better water for bathing and devices.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends on the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
