<p>Protect your home from leaks. There are numerous things that you need to consider to help you choose when you need a water heater replacement. A good basic rule of thumb is that when your existing hot water heater reaches its 10th birthday, you ought to start preparing for a replacement.

When the day comes that it stops working, this method you won't have a surprise expenditure on your hands.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Lowered Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Inspect spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction across the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position.
