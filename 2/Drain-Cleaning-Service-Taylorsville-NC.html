Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Usually, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is minor, but if you have actually been advised by a doctor to follow a rigorous low salt diet this increase can present problems.</p>

<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits collect, till they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits occur more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you wish to make doubly sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs.</p>
