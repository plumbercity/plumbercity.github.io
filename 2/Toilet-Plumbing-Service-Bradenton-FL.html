We are now ready to start the re-assembly procedure. Some designs require the parts to be removed in a specific order. These assemblies will likewise need the re-assembly in a particular order. Many elements can not be re-installed into the body unless the test dicks are left open. As each component is returned into the body, it is important to put them back in the right place.

Once again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air space, if there is no way to provide one, then we inspect to see that the proper BFP device is set up.
