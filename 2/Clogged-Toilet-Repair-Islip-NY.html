If there is a backflow incident at just one home in a neighborhood, there is the potential for pollutants to spread out into the general public water system, threatening your next-door neighbors. A properly operating backflow assembly can help prevent this.</p>
<p>Difficult water is triggered by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to get rid of these minerals. When the water is available in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are changed in the solution by the salt ions.</p>

Continued efforts on your own can harm your lines, and you might have a more major underlying problem than you understand.
