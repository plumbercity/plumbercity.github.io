Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a regular incident, but it does occur more frequently than you think! When you do not see the water was off for a few minutes, frequently it occurs at night. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or hook up a new pipe. This makes construction jobs quickly the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common reason for backflow. Fire trucks use substantial pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This often triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding areas.</p>
