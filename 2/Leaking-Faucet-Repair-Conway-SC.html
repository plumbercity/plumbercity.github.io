<h3>Frozen Pips in Conway South Carolina</h2>
<p>Repairing a faucet or sink itself is often a matter of clearing a clogged drain However, after over 30 years of fixing every make and model of sink and faucet in the Triangle or Sandhills, we can state that there are much more common problems. Bell Cow is your reliable local plumber and sink repair expert-- from quick repairs to structural repair, we do it all.</p>
<p>A common gas line can cost as much as $1,000. The labor costs increase if the gas line is under a walkway, lawn sprinkler or trees. Drain cleaning is something that you will eventually have to handle in any house. Sinks and toilets are utilized every day, often several times a day, so it's practically unavoidable that you're eventually going to encounter a clog. Now, there are many solutions to blockages, depending upon the severity of the obstruction.</p>
<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years old and you need to work with a plumber for that burner set. The overall repair costs might remain in the $300 range. A gas water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Choose the brand-new heater.</p>
