<p>Your house's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not truly the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there will not go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
