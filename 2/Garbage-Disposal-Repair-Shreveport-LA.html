<p>Odd Sounds - If uncommon gurgling is coming from your drain, it probably needs an extensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it difficult for the water to travel through. The pipes often make weird gurgling noises as water efforts to pass through a clogged pipe due to the fact that of the tight space. This causes the water to bubble, as only small pockets of air are accessible, resulting in the odd sounds originating from your sink.</p>
<p>Replacing your flapper may require somewhat various steps than we show (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube.

You may not discover an identical match, however opportunities are you'll locate among the exact same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
