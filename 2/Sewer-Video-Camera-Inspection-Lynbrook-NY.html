<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts may have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An important thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the component. The guide is a really important part of the design of each component. If the part is not fixed properly, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than direct or consistent) of the element, which might cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
