<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- destructive. For this factor, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this type of deterioration A softener is simply catching some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (typically sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>

When a sprinkler activates due to heat, the air is released, allowing the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to suppress the fire.</p>
