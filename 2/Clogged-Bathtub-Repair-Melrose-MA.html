<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet in Melrose MA 02176</h3>
<p>I bought a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, because I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months earlier. I feel that prices were increased since I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March said depending on the market and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
<p>If you're dealing with a trusted plumber in Utah, they will generally back up their deal with a warranty. That suggests if something goes wrong later on, you will have someone who can fix it without any added costs. The alternative diy (DIY) approach uses no such assurances, and in many cases unless you understand a lot about plumbing, there's a quite considerable danger that you might do more damage. When that occurs, you will most likely need to call a plumber anyway to fix your errors, and opportunities are they will cost more and be harder than if you had actually simply called a professional in the first location.</p>
