<p>Weird Sounds - If uncommon gurgling is coming from your drain, it probably needs a thorough cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it challenging for the water to go through. The pipes frequently make strange gurgling sounds as water attempts to pass through a clogged pipe due to the fact that of the tight space. This causes the water to bubble, as just little pockets of air are accessible, leading to the odd sounds originating from your sink.</p>
<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is really low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is an incredibly pure form of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
