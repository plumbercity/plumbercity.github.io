<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and insured and satisfy our rigid trust certification requirements. An excellent guideline is to replace faucets that reveal deterioration, rust, cracks, and otherwise deep damages. Worn out and rusted parts make repairs expensive and hard, implying a faucet installation is more rewarding. Repairs are the correct fix for problems such as missing out on or harmed washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small parts of the entire fixture. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we suggest a new faucet installation.</p>

Scientists found that softened water uses nearly 30% less detergent, but cleans as well as water at 10 gpg firmness level. That detergent savings increases to almost 70% when comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level.</p>
