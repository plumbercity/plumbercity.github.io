<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively imagined. If you have reasonably difficult water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams.
