<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Monroe OH 45050</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these aspects are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
