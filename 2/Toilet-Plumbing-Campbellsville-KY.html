<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Services Campbellsville KY</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, cable television or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
