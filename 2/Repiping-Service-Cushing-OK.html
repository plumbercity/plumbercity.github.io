<h3>Quality Plumbing Services In Cushing OK</h3>
<p>No warm water-- The lack of hot water is the biggest indication that there is something incorrect with your San Antonio hot water heater. You may have sediment that has actually developed up in the unit and separated the water from the heat source if you aren't getting sufficient hot water for your shower. It's time to speak with the experts if your water heater isn't doing its only task.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have moderately hard water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
