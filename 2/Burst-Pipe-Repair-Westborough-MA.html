<p>Leakages are sneaky. In time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capability to soften tough water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, providing the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>Template-Assisted Crystallization: Shortened to TAC, this technique uses resin beads as a catalytic nucleation site where firmness mineral ions are become a stable crystalline form that will not hold on to surface areas.
