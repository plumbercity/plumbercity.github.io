<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and insured and meet our rigid trust accreditation standards.

Run-down and rusted parts make repairs difficult and pricey, implying a faucet installation is more rewarding. Repairs are the right fix for issues such as missing out on or harmed washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other little elements of the whole fixture. If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we recommend a brand-new faucet installation.</p>

<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Felton DE</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, snake or cable television auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY project. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have moderately difficult water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
