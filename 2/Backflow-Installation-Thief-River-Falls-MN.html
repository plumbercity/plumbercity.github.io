For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to crack and solidify or merely be so squished that it does not fill the space in addition to it used to, and you end up with water all over the location.
