As the outer coating of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>

Instead of dislodging the blockage with unfavorable pressure, it actually pushes into the clog, working further into where the obstruction is taking place.

The auger's corkscrew-shaped idea helps require it further down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>
