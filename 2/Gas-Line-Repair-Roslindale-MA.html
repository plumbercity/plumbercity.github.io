<p>In some neighborhoods, home water softeners drain to community wastewater treatment plants, which are not designed to remove chloride. The chloride goes through the treatment plant and winds up in our streams and lakes. In houses with private wells and home softeners, chloride drains to the home's septic tank and after that winds up in lakes and streams.</p>
<p>It doesn't necessarily imply they need to be changed if your pipes are older than these guidelines. Well-kept pipes might last longer, and badly preserved ones or those in locations with hard water (implying it has high mineral content), may stop working faster, states Passaic, N.J., plumber Joseph Gove, who provided the lifespan estimates.</p>
