<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one must initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these aspects are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
