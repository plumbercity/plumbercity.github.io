<p>When the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process. It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on extremely gradually to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system ought to be examined to guarantee no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close appropriately.

<p>This article aims to resolve the typical misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes corrosion This is not the case: a properly set up water softener does not make the treated water more corrosive. Here are a few complicated realities that often lead individuals to this erroneous conclusion. First, naturally soft water is generally destructive. For that reason, softened water must also be corrosive, right? This is a fallacy due to the fact that naturally soft water tends to be corrosive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening triggers neither of these conditions.</p>
