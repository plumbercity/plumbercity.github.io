<p>When the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair process. It is necessary that the plumbing system be switched on very gradually to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to make sure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close effectively. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are totally open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like material covered with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the system while the resin launches its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
