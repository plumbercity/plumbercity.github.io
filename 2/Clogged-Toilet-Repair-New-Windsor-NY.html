<h3>Most Effective Drain Cleaning Methods New Windsor NY</h3>
<p>A freshly installed water heater should not produce weird sounds, but it will start to create rumbling sounds as it ages. The noises get louder gradually as the heater goes to warm the water. Things worsen significantly for homes with a high demand for warm water. The reasons for the sounds can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which must be flushed to bring back normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has actually been flushed, a water heater replacement may be essential.</p>
<p>Water softening describes the elimination of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular method of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another kind of ion-- usually salt. The result is water that's been effectively softened by getting rid of almost all traces of the minerals that make up hard water.</p>
