The high-resolution light offers a clear image for the specialist to properly examine conditions and diagnose the performance of the pipes. The information we obtain from the inspection permits us to make an informed decision regarding the condition of your pipes and suggest the best solution as well. We can make the perfect suggestion with self-confidence if the pipe needs to be cleaned up of obstructions or relined with epoxy resin.</p>
