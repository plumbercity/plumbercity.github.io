<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and guaranteed and fulfill our rigid trust certification standards. An excellent general rule is to replace faucets that reveal corrosion, rust, cracks, and otherwise deep damages. Run-down and corroded parts make repairs costly and hard, suggesting a faucet installation is more worthwhile. Repairs are the correct fix for problems such as missing out on or harmed washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other little components of the whole fixture. If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we advise a brand-new faucet installation.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet clogs are not uncommon, but if your toilet is blocking more than 3 times a month, there's a larger problem to examine. You may need to change toilet paper or hire a plumber to clear a blockage from the drain if your toilet is fairly brand-new. The National Contractor License Service maintains a list of each state's professional licensing company where you can search for your state's licensing info. Inspect the list of state licensing agencies to learn whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also maintains a licensing tool to inspect state licensing requirements.</p>
