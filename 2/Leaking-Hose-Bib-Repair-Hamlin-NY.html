<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems typically are set up in areas where water might trigger catastrophic damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and locations with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>

<p>The labor costs for disposal installation are primarily time related. If everything is all set, in excellent condition, and the disposal is on hand and quickly put in, the plumber will likely only charge for an hour or two of time. If things need to be modified, replaced, or relocated to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours required and for that reason the overall costs. A lot of plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with many disposal installations running $50 per hour for 3 hours overall, making the labor expenses roughly $150.</p>
