Variations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt a correctly functioning RPZ assembly to occasionally release small amounts of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a large volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be set up in locations based on water damage. Adequate drainage must also be offered.</p>
