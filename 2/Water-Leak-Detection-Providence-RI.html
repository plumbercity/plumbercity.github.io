When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it tough for the water to go through.

The successive 90 ° turns in such a setup can lead to inappropriate drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you may have the ability to cut off its elbow and use the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
