<p>We have a long and clean enduring repipe or piping option for your house. It is called PEX cross-linked polyethylene and Uponor pipe tubing. If you take a close look at the image you will see a pipe that is meant to remain clean on the within.  Because of the non metallic of the flexible nature of this product, there is no way that it will ever rust on the within.</p>
<p>To eliminate the smells, initially try pouring BioSmart (offered at WJ McNabb Plumbing) down your drain. You can also attempt 1 cup lemon juice down the drain. After a few minutes, run warm water down the drain. Unattainable or insufficient cleanouts: No matter how effective a drainage system is, it will likely get clogged at some time.
