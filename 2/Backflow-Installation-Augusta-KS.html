Although you can't see into these drains, cleaning them resembles a process used to clear debris from the side seamless gutter pipes on your home.</p>

<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one must initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these components are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new sodium ions.</p>
