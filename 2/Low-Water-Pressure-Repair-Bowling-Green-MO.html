Sewer repairs are more than a trouble for your service, they can cause monetary losses and in some circumstances can stop your company entirely.

<p>If you don't have a plumber's snake, you can utilize a wire coat hanger by correcting it. Naturally, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it may be long enough to reach some obstructions. Insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or pull out the clog if you can reach it. Take care not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
