<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made between the drinkable water supply and non-potable water or substances a backflow assembly is required to be set up. An authorized, correctly set up and preserved backflow assembly essentially gets rid of the threat of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Make sure that the softener is filled with sodium or potassium chloride following the maker's suggestions.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is small, however if you've been advised by a doctor to follow a rigorous low sodium diet this increase can pose problems.</p>
<p>The simplest option may appear to be just neglecting the issue or utilizing a do it yourself chemical option. Nevertheless, this is a temporary fix and might trigger more damage. Some pipe products, like copper or cast-iron, are sensitive to chemicals. Chemical cleaners can corrode and erode your pipes, causing significant leakages, cracks, and large damages.</p>
