<p>Lastly, the most complex and advanced backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 independently running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. During basic water flows at style pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline.
