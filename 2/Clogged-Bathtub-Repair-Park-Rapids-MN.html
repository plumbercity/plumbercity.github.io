<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Generally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is minor, but if you've been advised by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>
<p>We've currently seen what these 2 terms share, so what's the difference in between them? When it concerns the concern of difficult water, a traditional water softener in fact removes silica, magnesium and calcium ions, leaving it with small quantities of what is referred to as short-lived hardness". The softener replaces these ions with salt through a procedure called ion exchange.</p>
