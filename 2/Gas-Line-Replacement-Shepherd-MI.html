Bear in mind that since of the way a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the proper method. When you've protected the trip lever and are ready to connect your flapper, make certain you've got simply enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the method when you push down on the journey lever.</p>
