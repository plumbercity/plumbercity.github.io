<p>Some hot water heater problems are small sufficient to be effectively addressed with professional repairs.

<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange websites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use once backwashing is total. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>Broken sewer pipes can be more than just an expensive repair-- they can lead to substantial and expensive property damage and cause serious health risks.
