<p>Great deals of bad things are being said on this post about liners. I discover that many old time plumbers are not educated on liners and have no idea on what they are stating. Due to the fact that they don't like the technology and not since it doesn't work, will likewise state something does not work well simply. If this heater is installed in a home with multiple restrooms, the piping procedure adds to the installation expenses.</p>
