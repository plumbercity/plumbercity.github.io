<p>Whether you need waste disposal unit repair or installation, Maeser can assist. A waste disposal unit is an important kitchen appliance in a lot of homes today. While the majority of kitchen sink disposers can deal with nearly any kind of food waste, they are not indestructible.

Worn impellers on older disposals can end up being ineffective, increasing the danger of drain obstructions.</p>
