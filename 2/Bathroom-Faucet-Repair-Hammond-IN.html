<p>In water supply systems, water is typically kept at a significant pressure to make it possible for water to stream from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure may stop working or be minimized when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an all of a sudden high demand on the water supply (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe may allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
<p>If it gradually drains away as you work, include more hot water. Keep plunging till the drain is clear or you choose it's time to attempt a brand-new technique.
