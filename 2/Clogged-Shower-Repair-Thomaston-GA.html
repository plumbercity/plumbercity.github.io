<p>Leaks are tricky. With time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capability to soften difficult water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>Then connect the waste pipe (and dishwasher hose, if suitable). If your system is outlet-ready-- pay attention to this part-- make certain your disposal switch remains in the off" position before you plug the brand-new unit in.
