During a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain service technician runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line.

Connections that are too tight can really trigger leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If needed, check for leakages and tighten them a bit more.</p>
