<p>Sewer lines have one vital role: carry wastewater out of a home or building. Although these property owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was definitely great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in good enough shape to reline prior to the issue worsened. Waiting just wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a detached garage. At the least, it would have been a really costly option.</p>
<p>A testable backflow prevention device has 2 check valves-- essentially 2 layers of security. The device permits water to push the check valves open when water is entering into the building, however closes them shut when water tries to go the incorrect way. There are 2 different types of testable backflow prevention devices that are commonly specified-- a decreased pressure zone backflow device and a double check backflow device. There are a couple of others that I will mention but do not get hung up on them. Because they will be on an accreditation test, I discuss them only.</p>
