<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a variety of products were used for home plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most typical metals, while clay was utilized for sewer line piping. Although all these products are durable in the short-term, they deteriorate over years. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are susceptible to various types of deterioration. After about fifty years, they'll begin to weaken from rust and may put contaminants into the freshwater supply. We suggest replacing the iron, steel, and clay pipes in your home.
