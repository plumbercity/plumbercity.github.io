When your water lines are repiped, it simply means old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We find that homes 15 years or older who have actually never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement.

If you do have regular leaks, we discover that repiping can in fact be the less expensive and better long-lasting solution.</p>
