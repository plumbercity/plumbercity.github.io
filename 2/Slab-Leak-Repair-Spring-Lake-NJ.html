When switched on the motor spins and impellers-- also called lugs-- toss littles food versus a grinder ring.

They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs.
