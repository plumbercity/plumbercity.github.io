<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another visit, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>

<p>Suggestion: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not prevent back-pressure. I recently had a number of plumbing leakages fixed and could not be happier with the prompt service I got from Parker and Sons. They are really knowledgeable, friendly, reasonably priced, and do quality work. I would definitely suggest them to my family and everyone. I would trust them to repair any leak in your home.</p>
<p>Now wait a minute, some people state, doesn't the water pressure in the water supply keep the irrigation water from reversing? Yes, most of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a frequent occurrence, however it does occur more often than you believe! When you do not notice the water was off for a few minutes, often it occurs at night. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or connect a brand-new pipe. This makes building tasks easily the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire battling is another common cause of backflow. Fire trucks utilize huge pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding communities.</p>
