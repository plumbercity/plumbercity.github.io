When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not actually the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes.

Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a frequent incident, but it does take place regularly than you believe! Often it takes place in the evening when you do not notice the water was off for a couple of minutes.
