When your hot water heater isn't working appropriately, it's an inconvenience. Sometimes, hot water heater breakdowns can likewise threaten.

<p>Single flush High Efficiency Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The current double flush HET used by Bonney will utilize an average of 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We suggest, as a lot of plumbers do, to utilize disposals sparingly. Proper care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
