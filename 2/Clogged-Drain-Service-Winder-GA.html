<p>Your home's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not truly the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there will not go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
<p>However is a plumbing disaster imminent or just an issue for the distant future? Changing old pipes in a 1,500 square foot, two-bathroom home expenses $4,000 to $10,000, and requires cutting open walls and floors, so you certainly don't want to do the job prior to it's required. Here's how to evaluate your plumbing system and know when it's time for replacement.</p>
<p>Hard water is brought on by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to eliminate these minerals. When the water is available in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the solution by the sodium ions.</p>
<p>Eliminate all parts of the disposer package from the box, and organize the contents. Remove the P-trap and existing drain basket assembly carefully from the sink (Images 1 and 2). Place a large pan listed below the sink to capture water that might spill when you detach the drain, and keep a towel nearby to tidy up spills.
