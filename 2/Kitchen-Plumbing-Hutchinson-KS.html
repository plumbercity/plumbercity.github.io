<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix it Yourself in Hutchinson KS 67501!</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, considering that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months back. I feel that prices were increased since I had a "Deal". An Angie's list short article from March stated depending upon the marketplace and intensity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
