<p>A water softener has 2 tanks: a mineral tank and a brine tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, takes place. It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the sodium, or salt, is stored and blended with water. If you plan to drain  your automated dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate undamaged if you will not utilize your unit to drain a dishwasher.</p>
<p>As an utility company that supplies vital public services, our focus is on making sure the continued reliability and security of our service to clients, in addition to the health and safety of our employees. Sluggish drains: If you discover that your drains are clearing slower, it might be indicative of the early phases of a clog.
