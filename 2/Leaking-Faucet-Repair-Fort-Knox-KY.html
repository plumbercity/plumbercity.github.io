The biggest of these main long-distance sending pipes are referred to as aqueducts. Generally constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) strengthened concrete pipe segments, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable finishing, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes developed to bring bulk circulation amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and distribution nodes where the circulations are transferred to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines.
