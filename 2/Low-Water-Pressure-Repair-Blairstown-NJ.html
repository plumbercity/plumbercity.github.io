<p>For shallow pipes with no nearby energies or obstructions, digging through and changing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your harmed pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or pathways, dig-free pipe lining might save you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more. Set a pail under the P-trap and disconnect the drainpipes. Then get rid of the sink strainer. Eliminate any excess putty.</p>
