When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to guarantee that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the community water supply, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the sprinkler system can end up being polluted. There is potential for the polluted water to become a health risk if allowed to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected regularly for effectiveness, in addition to checked annually by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
