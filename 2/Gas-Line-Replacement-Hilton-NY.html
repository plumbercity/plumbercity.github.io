<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank do not constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if essential. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a brand-new ball valve while you're at it (Picture 6). Vent sizes are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You may have to increase or decrease the vent size to guarantee the best draft. CAUTION: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
