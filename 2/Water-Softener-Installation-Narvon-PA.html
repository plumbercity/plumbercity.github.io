<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as hard water scale, silt, sand, and grease deposits.</p>
<p>Please let EBMUD know of any scenario that may need a backflow device. In some cases conditions on properties change that may need a backflow device, such as dealing with a boiler with additives or installing a well with a pump.
