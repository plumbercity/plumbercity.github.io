<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly pictured. If you have moderately tough water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>

<h3>How to Overcome Sink Drain Problems in White Cloud MI 49349</h3>
<p>Discussing whether to repair or replace your water heater? Our professionals will provide you a truthful recommendation. In general, older water heaters (over 8-10 years) experiencing repeating problems are much better off being changed. A more recent, more effective water heater will conserve you in repair costs and energy with time. Old-fashioned water softeners are notorious for causing a spike in the cost of your regular monthly utility expenses. Many require large quantities of water and can be pricey for the electrical energy costs, however the NuvoH2O system is different. Our saltless H2O conditioning system uses up to 4x less water than others and requires no electrical energy.</p>
