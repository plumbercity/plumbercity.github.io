<p>As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will build up in numerous parts of the plumbing system, most commonly in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can trigger low flow issues or perhaps stop a component from flowing altogether. The next common issue that occurs with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which takes place when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so serious that it minimizes the readily available volume of water that can flow around the system.</p>
