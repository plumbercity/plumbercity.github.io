<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Examine spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction throughout the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>

<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must initially consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these components are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
