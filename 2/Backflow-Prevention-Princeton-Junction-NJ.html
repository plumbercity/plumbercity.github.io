<h3>How To Select A Credible Plumber Princeton Junction NJ</h3>
<p>A video camera inspection takes the uncertainty out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to collect your lawn. During a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain professional runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images recorded by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as obstructions, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
<p>During regeneration, the water softener will take the salt water solution into the softener tank and the ion exchange process occurs again, just this time in reverse. At the time of inspection, make certain to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the entire system.
