<p>Your house's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not actually the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there will not go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>

<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits build up, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits occur more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up if you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue prior to you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
