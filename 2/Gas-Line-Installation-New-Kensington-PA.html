<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that enables water to go through it in one instructions, but prevents it from going backwards in the opposite instructions. You may be familiar with galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, put simply, the same thing, however without the zinc finishing. The zinc finish on galvanized pipe for gas is meant to keep the pipe from corroding from contact with wetness. While it does its job quite well, gradually, it still does corrode. This enables the toilet to flush. A plumber will charge $135 to fix it.</p>
