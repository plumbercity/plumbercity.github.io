Some parts might have extremely tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the part. The guide is an extremely important part of the style of each part. If the element is not fixed appropriately, the guide could limit the movement (rather than steady or direct) of the element, which could trigger the part to not work to its capabilities.
