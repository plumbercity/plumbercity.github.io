<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these components are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
