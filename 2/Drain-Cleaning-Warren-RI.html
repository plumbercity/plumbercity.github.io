<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection requests. No hot water in your house? Is your water taking too long to warm up? Is your water heater making noises, or do you see rusty colored water in your home? If you have any of these concerns, your water heater may need maintenance, repairs or perhaps a replacement. While some of these concerns can be attributed to normal wear and tear or improper installation, often your garbage disposal ends up being damaged by products that shouldn't be run through it.</p>
<p>Because it is more cost-effective to power them with gas than with electrical power, these types of hot water heaters are usually powered by natural gas. Gas water heaters cost more than electric water heaters to install initially, but end up costing about half as much to run - saving you substantial quantities of money on your utility costs in the long run.</p>
