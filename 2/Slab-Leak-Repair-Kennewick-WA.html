<p>You can also depend on water softeners to reduce your daily operating expense by conserving cleaning agent and permitting you to use lower water temperature levels while maintaining a high-quality wash. Water solidity, measured by the grains per gallon (gpg) of magnesium and calcium in the water, differs across the U.S. from slightly difficult (<3 gpg) to very hard (>14 gpg).</p>
<p>Warning: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations brought on by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The possibility of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however in most cases it must be much less water.</p>
