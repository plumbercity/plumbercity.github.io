<p>Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water functions must have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. These water features are considered a health danger if backflows take place from them. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and area should be shown on building and construction plans. Any backflow preventer set up on a water fountain or garden pond need to be evaluated upon installation and after that every year.</p>
<p>Alternatively, there might be a fracture in the porcelain, either the tank or the toilet bowl itself.
