<p>E.R. Services comprehends the value of maintaining the integrity and efficiency of your kitchen. Because we use our water heaters so often, they are at threat of breaking down regularly.

Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
