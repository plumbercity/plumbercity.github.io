When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to guarantee that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the lawn sprinkler can become polluted. If allowed to re-enter the water supply, there is potential for the infected water to become a health threat. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for efficiency, as well as inspected annually by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
