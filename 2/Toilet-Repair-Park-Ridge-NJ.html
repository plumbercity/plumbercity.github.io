<p>It is very important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt a correctly operating RPZ assembly to regularly discharge small amounts of water.

Appropriate drainage must likewise be provided.</p>
