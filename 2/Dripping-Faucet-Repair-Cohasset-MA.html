<p>The EcoWater ESS1152 Series are non-resin based systems that can be tailored to your water needs. Your EcoWater Pro will test your water to figure out the ideal water treatment for your home. Since the softener's salt water tank nests inside of the salt tank, a single tank or cabinet-style system needs less area. The CareSoft ® system was developed with the same sophisticated engineering as the Pro and Elite models, with resin that provides high-performance hardness elimination you can rely on for years to come.</p>
<p>The labor expenses for disposal installation are primarily time related. If whatever is ready, in excellent condition, and the disposal is on hand and easily put in, the plumber will likely just charge for an hour or two of time. If things need to be modified, replaced, or moved to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours required and for that reason the total expenses. Many plumbers charge in between $45 and $65 per hour, with many disposal setups running $50 per hour for 3 hours overall, making the labor expenses approximately $150.</p>
