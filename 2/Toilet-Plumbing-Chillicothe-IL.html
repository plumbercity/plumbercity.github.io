<h3>What Do I Do If a Faucet Leaks in Chillicothe IL 61523?</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>

<p>It's an oddly complex scientific process, but easy to treat. It uses salt to eliminate smells and minerals discovered in hard water- most frequently calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems utilize resin beads that attract and connect salt ions in the softener tank. Pumps press hard water through the resin beads exchanging firmness ions with salt ions, softening the water.</p>
