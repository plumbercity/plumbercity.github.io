<h3>Kitchen Faucet Leaking in Riverdale Georgia</h2>
<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code protects the general public water supply and private on-site supply of water and circulation systems by forbiding cross-connections in between safe and clean (suitable for drinking) and non-potable water supply, and by needing installation of main and secondary backflow prevention approaches. Secondary backflow approaches provide an increased level of defense for the general public water supply system.</p>
<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return due to the fact that he had another appointment. A best bad plumber story.</p>
