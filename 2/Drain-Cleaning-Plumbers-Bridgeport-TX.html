<p>Leaks are sneaky. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capacity to soften hard water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a focused quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
