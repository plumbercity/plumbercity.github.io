However, many people wait until the drain stops totally before they take corrective action. Call us prior to your problems get this bad.

<p>Difficult water is brought on by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to remove these minerals. When the water is available in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are changed in the service by the sodium ions.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes without any nearby utilities or blockages, digging through and replacing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or walkways, dig-free pipe lining could conserve you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a pail under the P-trap and detach the drains. Then get rid of the sink strainer. Eliminate any excess putty.</p>
