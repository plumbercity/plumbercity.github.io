<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Eugene OR 97402?</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
