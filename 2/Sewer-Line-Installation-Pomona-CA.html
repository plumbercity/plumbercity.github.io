Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
