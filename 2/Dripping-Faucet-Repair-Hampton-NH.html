<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Hampton NH</h3>
<p>A video camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to dig up your yard. Throughout a camera inspection, a sewer and drain specialist runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line.

<p>Prior to setting up, your professional will shut off water and electricity to the area. Next, the old sink flange is eliminated and cleaned up of any putty residue.

In this method, water is treated with a calculated amount of washing soda (Na2CO3) which transforms the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their particular carbonates which get precipitated.</p>
<p>Have used Plumb Crazy on three different events, the last involving a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our house. Billy and Hector were our specialists and they were great.
