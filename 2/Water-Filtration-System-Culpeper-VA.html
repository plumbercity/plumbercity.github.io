<p>Have used Plumb Crazy on 3 different events, the last involving a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our house. Billy and Hector were our technicians and they were wonderful. They rapidly found the leak and repaired it without making a substantial mess. They, just like each person we've encountered with Plumb Crazy, were considerate, timely, and really well-informed.

<p>Tankless electrical water heaters come in 2 types. There are whole-house heaters that are big and powerful enough to provide warm water to all bathrooms, kitchens, and appliances in a home. On the other hand, there are the point-of-use electrical heaters that supply warm water to particular spaces or appliances just. Both whole-house and point-of-use heaters work the same method. The only distinction is the quantity of water they can warm up at any provided time. Also, whole-house units are significantly more pricey than the point of use systems.</p>
