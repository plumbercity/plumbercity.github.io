<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in New Hyde Park NY 11040?</h3>

Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a frequent occurrence, but it does take place more often than you think! Frequently it takes place during the night when you do not observe the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the water company needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or link a brand-new pipe. This makes construction projects quickly the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire battling is another common reason for backflow. Fire trucks utilize huge pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently triggers the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding areas.</p>
