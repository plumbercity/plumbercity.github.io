It is suggested that you enable your unit to go empty of one type of salt prior to adding another to prevent the event of any problems.

And make certain a plumbing or electrical inspector checks your work.</p>
<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on particular new sinks, but these will be labeled to that result. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. When you tighten the locknut in location, excess putty will squeeze out between the new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without catching on the gasket.</p>
