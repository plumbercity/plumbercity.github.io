WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain.

Recurring repairs and leakages. If your water heater is over 10 years old, it has likely lost much of its performance; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not cost-effective in the long run. As an outcome, we advise changing your system if it is over 10 years old.</p>
