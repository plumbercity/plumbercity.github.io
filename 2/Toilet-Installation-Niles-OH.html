<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years old and you have to hire a plumber for that burner set. The overall repair expense may remain in the $300 range. A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800).
