<p>Organic particles, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, cable television or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's DIY task. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
