<p>Downsides to be knowledgeable about is that hybrid water heaters need to be installed in an area that stays in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heat pump is on top of the water heater. Also, hybrids require approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to capture enough heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
<p>The EcoWater ESS1152 Series are non-resin based systems that can be tailored to your water needs. Your EcoWater Pro will check your water to identify the best water treatment for your home. A single tank or cabinet-style system needs less area since the softener's salt water tank nests inside of the salt tank. The CareSoft ® system was established with the exact same sophisticated engineering as the Pro and Elite designs, with resin that delivers high-performance firmness elimination you can rely on for many years to come.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes with no close-by utilities or obstructions, digging through and changing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally.
