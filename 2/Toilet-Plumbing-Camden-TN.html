<p>The brand-new inlets and outlets on the tank don't constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if required. Likewise replace the old shutoff valve with a brand-new ball valve while you're at it (Image 6). Vent sizes are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You may need to increase or decrease the vent size to guarantee the best draft. CARE: If you're unsure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is extensively pictured. If you have moderately tough water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
