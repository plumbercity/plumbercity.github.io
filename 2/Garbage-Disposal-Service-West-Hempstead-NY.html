<h3>Top Rated Atlanta Plumber West Hempstead NY</h3>
<p>Most houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather security. As the outer covering of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
