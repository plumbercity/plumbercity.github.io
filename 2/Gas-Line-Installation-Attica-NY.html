<p>No other room in a house contains as lots of pipes and plumbing fixtures as the bathroom. Try to find quality materials when replacing an under-sink assembly. Avoid flex pipe that can be bent into any setup, in addition to versatile rubber traps.

PVC assemblies are an excellent choice s they can be easily attached to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and ensure it sets before testing the drain.</p>
<p>You depend on your drains to carry wastewater from your tub, shower or sink. In time, the drains end up being clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more.
