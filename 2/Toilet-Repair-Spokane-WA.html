Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another visit, they called him back and he stated he would not come back.
