<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another appointment, they called him back and he stated he would not come back.

<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two various types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating product that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
