<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection requests. No warm water in your house? Is your water taking too long to heat up? Is your water heater making sounds, or do you see rusty colored water in your home? If you have any of these problems, your water heater may need maintenance, repairs and even a replacement. While a few of these problems can be attributed to typical wear and tear or improper installation, sometimes your garbage disposal ends up being damaged by products that shouldn't be run through it.</p>
<p>At Peoples, our goal is to maintain safe, reliable natural gas service for our consumers. We are actively keeping an eye on the unique coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak worldwide and in the U.S. We are working carefully with the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention and the local health authorities to continually keep an eye on the scenario and evaluate our operational reaction plans.</p>

<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from normal circulation instructions within a piping system that is caused by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of regular flow in a system caused by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water system piping). Back-siphonage can happen when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is reduced main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>Depending on the level of the clog, we may use a range of different techniques, the most common being hydro-jetting. Hydro-jetting is an innovative type of drain cleaning where we utilize water under high pressure to entirely clear out whatever inside your drains. Lay the waste disposal unit on its side and eliminate the electrical cover plate from the bottom. Loosen the green ground screw and remove wire ports. Disconnect waste disposal unit wires from electrical supply wires. Loosen up screws on the electrical clamp adapter and eliminate wires from the garbage disposal.</p>
<p>GGP is always prepared to repair any of these types of sinks. Ought to you come across a specialized faucet repair that requires special order parts, we can position the order and get the sink repaired as quickly as the part gets here. Ion exchange resins, in the form of beads, are a practical component of domestic water softening units. Strap the water heater to the wall with special straps (Fig if you live in an earthquake-prone region. A; available at plumbing shops and house centers). If they're required, your plumbing inspector will tell you.</p>
