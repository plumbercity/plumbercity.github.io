<p>CPVC (chlorinated polyvinyl chloride) is one of the most common kinds of plastic piping utilized in plumbing systems today.

<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one ought to initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these elements are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
