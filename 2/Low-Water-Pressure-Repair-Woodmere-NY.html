<h3>Plumbing - Leaky Faucets and Water Waste in Woodmere NY 11598</h3>
<p>Water that has been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this kind of deterioration A softener is merely catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (usually salt or often potassium).</p>
