<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts may have really tight tolerances that need to be maintained. A crucial thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the part. The guide is a really important part of the design of each element. If the element is not repaired correctly, the guide might limit the movement (instead of direct or consistent) of the component, which could cause the element to not work to its abilities.

In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
