Damaged and rusted parts make repairs pricey and hard, indicating a faucet installation is more rewarding. Repairs are the correct fix for concerns such as missing or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small components of the entire fixture. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we recommend a brand-new faucet installation.</p>
