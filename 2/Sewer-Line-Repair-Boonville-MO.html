<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation need, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
