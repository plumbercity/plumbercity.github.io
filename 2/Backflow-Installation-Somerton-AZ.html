<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly envisioned. If you have reasonably tough water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water.
