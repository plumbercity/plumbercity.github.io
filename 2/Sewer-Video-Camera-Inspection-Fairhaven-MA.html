<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another consultation, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>

If you decide to hunt for a washer, remove it and take it to the shop to discover a match. Plumbers usually replace the whole fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
