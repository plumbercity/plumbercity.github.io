The very best way to avoid drain obstructions is to view what you flush. If you look at your home's plumbing pipes and see spots, discoloration, flaking, small imprints or rust, your pipes are wearing away. Rusting pipes are more likely to spring a leak (if they haven't currently) and need to be replaced as soon as possible.</p>
