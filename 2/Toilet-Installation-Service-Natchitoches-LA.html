<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
