<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal service is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in.

Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for many years, however steel ultimately suffers from rust and lacks the resilience these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
