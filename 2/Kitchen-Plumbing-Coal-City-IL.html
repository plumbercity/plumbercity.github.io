<p>A backflow preventer is a means or system to avoid backflow. The basic methods of avoiding backflow is an air space, which either removes a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow.

<p>Your disposer may feature a thin rubber gasket to be used under the sink flange, instead of the traditional plumber's putty as outlined below.

<p>Testing: A preventative look at your gas lines averages between $50 and $75 a see, and it needs to include a pressure test to check for leakages accurately. Testing could save you a lot of cash.

<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the local water system, or other source of drinking water.
