<p>A. Typically wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>The connections of kitchen sink faucets are another common leak-prone area. These can also be challenging to repair as they are usually located behind the sink, in confined spaces. The best way to tighten them is with a set of locking pliers. Wrenches use up excessive space and need a wide swing angle, which may be difficult to get in little areas.</p>
