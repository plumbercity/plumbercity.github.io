<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends upon the extent of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>

<p>Dry pipe systems generally are installed in big, unheated areas, such as parking lot. These systems have actually pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed.
