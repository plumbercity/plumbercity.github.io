<h3>Why A Water Leak Detection System Is Important For Your Home in Georgetown MA 01833</h3>
<p>I bought a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed estimate to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, since I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months earlier. I feel that costs were increased due to the fact that I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March said depending on the market and severity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
<p>Suggestion: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not avoid back-pressure. I just recently had a number of plumbing leakages fixed and could not be better with the timely service I got from Parker and Sons. They are really knowledgeable, friendly, reasonably priced, and do quality work. I would absolutely recommend them to my household and everyone. I would trust them to repair any leak in your home.</p>
