<p>When a large adequate source of water has been identified and examined, the 3rd major part of a water supply system enters into play: a system of pipelines to communicate the water from its source to its customers.

Normally constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) enhanced concrete pipe segments, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable finishing, these are big underground and aboveground pipes developed to carry bulk flow amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and circulation nodes where the circulations are moved to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines.

<p>A camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to dig up your lawn. Throughout a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain technician runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images captured by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as clogs, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>

<p>More than often, small leakages in our houses are quickly repaired through welding and we disregard it as a petty problem. However if the leak problems are frequent and every once in a while some or the other corner of your home has water leaking, then it's time to call a plumber to check the entire piping system to perform home repiping. Multiple leakages shouldn't be disregarded at all; else it might cause complicated flooding issue soon.</p>
