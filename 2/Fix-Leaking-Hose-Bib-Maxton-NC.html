We'll learn what is causing your problems, then figure out the very best way to fix it for you and your household. 3 If your disposal does not have a cable clamp, screw one into the base of the disposer unit to protect the electrical cord. Unscrew the cover from the disposer's electrical compartment.</p>
<p>Your garbage disposal installation needs to be carried out by a professional plumber if you desire it to work well for years to come. It is a relatively easy device that draws food scraps down into a barbed grinder ring that rotates at high speeds, which crushes the scraps.

If you have a battle drain setup, it typically takes up your kitchen sink drain but can be installed on simply one side.</p>
<p>Physical strength. Pipefitters, plumbers, and steamfitters should be able to raise and move heavy tools and products. Suggestion: Location a heavy object such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving throughout installation.
