When your water lines are repiped, it simply suggests old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We find that houses 15 years or older who have never ever had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement.

The standard means of preventing backflow is an air space, which either eliminates a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow.

The primary kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly.
