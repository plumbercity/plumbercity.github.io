<p>Distribution pipes shift to even smaller individual service pipes, carrying water to specific houses, apartment services, shops and buildings. Depending upon need, these pipes vary in size from a half inch in diameter to 6 inches. Water goes into the consumer center by means of a water meter that tape-records flow rates and water utilization for billing functions. Private service pipelines are typically made from plastic, type or lead K copper. And it is here at the point of application where the installation of a backflow preventer can be vital.</p>
