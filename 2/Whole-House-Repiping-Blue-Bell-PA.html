And make certain a plumbing or electrical inspector checks your work.</p>
<p>You have most likely seen drain cleaner items on the racks at your local home improvement shop, so when your drain gets clogged or isn't draining water like it should, you might be lured to head down there and select some up to fix it on your own.

Eliminate the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening the three bolts and prying off the maintaining ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
