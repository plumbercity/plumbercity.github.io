<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly imagined. If you have reasonably tough water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
