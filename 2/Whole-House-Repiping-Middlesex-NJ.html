<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a range of materials were used for home plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most typical metals, while clay was utilized for sewer line piping. Although all these products are long lasting in the short-term, they weaken over decades. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are susceptible to several types of deterioration. After about fifty years, they'll begin to deteriorate from rust and may position toxins into the freshwater supply. We advise replacing the clay, steel, and iron pipes in your house.
