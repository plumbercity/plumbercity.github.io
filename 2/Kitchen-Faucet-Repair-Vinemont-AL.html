<p>Responsive flow technology works by continuously bringing tanks on-line and off-line in response to the water needs of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, only one of the four tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill up. This responsive style enables the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than standard single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the salt exchange websites are changed with firmness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use when backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
