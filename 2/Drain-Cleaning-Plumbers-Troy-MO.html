If your energy costs are increasing, a brand-new, greater performance hot water heater can bring them back down. All that needs to be done is blocking the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open the bypass valve, allowing hard water to stream to the storage tank and household taps. After that the softener can be disconnected, moved to its new location and positioned there.</p>

Continued attempts by yourself can harm your lines, and you may have a more major underlying problem than you understand.
