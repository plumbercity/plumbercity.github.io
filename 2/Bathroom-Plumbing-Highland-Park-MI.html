These dissolved ions offer difficult water its characteristics.</p>

<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Generally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in salt is minor, but if you've been recommended by a doctor to follow a stringent low sodium diet plan this boost can posture problems.</p>
<p>The most typical drain problem we are required is problems with drainage, such as a sink or tub that is sluggish to drain.
