<h3>Drain Cleaning Techniques in Stanford CA 94305</h3>
<p>I bought a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, since I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months ago. I feel that prices were increased due to the fact that I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March stated depending upon the marketplace and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
<p>Just how much is a sewer line inspection? These specialized evaluations consist of specialized camera equipment that runs into your sewer line. A camera inspection is much more tasty than trenching through the yard if you've spotted pooling water in the backyard. This will cost you (usually) in between $300-$ 400. Master plumber licenses are granted to plumbers who have actually held a journey license for a particular amount of time, and have accumulated the needed hours working as a licensed journey plumber.

<p>You hear water dripping or running in the tank. When water runs backward through your pipes and into the drinking water system, a backflow occurs. The water flowing in reverse from a cross-connection may pollute the drinking water supply. Yard watering systems, swimming pools, and jacuzzis are common cross-connection points. To speak to a garbage disposal repair plumber now, call All Klear Plumbing, Heating & Cooling at (417) 228-8252 Your satisfaction is our goal.</p>
<p>You must likewise regularly check your water heater burner. The flame under the heater need to appear blue with yellow tips.

The price to fix a toilet will depend upon what is exactly incorrect with the toilet and whether or not we have easy access to deal with the toilet.
