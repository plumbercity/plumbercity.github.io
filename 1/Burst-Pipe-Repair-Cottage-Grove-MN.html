Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
