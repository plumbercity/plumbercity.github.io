<p>Leaks are sly. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capability to soften hard water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, providing the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>
