Basic repairs require no customized tools or equipment and do not take a long period of time. Replacement parts are readily offered at your local house improvement shop. The most typical tools needed are a cordless drill, hacksaw, hammer drill, and locking pliers.</p>
<p>Here's what to anticipate on the day of your hot water heater installation visit. Setting up natural gas lines can bring a new level of service.
