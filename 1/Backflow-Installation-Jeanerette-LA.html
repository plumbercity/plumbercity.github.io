<p>CPM Plumbing focuses on speedy service, accurate troubleshooting, and accuracy repairs so your service never ever needs to struggle with downtime. Something to learn about gas lines is they can be extremely dangerous if there is a leak.

<p>In some neighborhoods, home water softeners drain to community wastewater treatment plants, which are not designed to get rid of chloride. The chloride goes through the treatment plant and winds up in our lakes and streams. In houses with private wells and house softeners, chloride drains to the home's septic tank and after that winds up in lakes and streams.</p>
<p>Gas line leaks are a major security concern. Don't take any opportunities. Make certain the softener is set to the hardness of your water supply.
