<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Pottsville PA</h3>
<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your home's equivalent of major surgery, it's actually something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with often. When your water lines are repiped, it just means old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We discover that homes 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. You could be in need of water line repiping if you have an older home and are experiencing regular and major leaks. We find that repiping can in fact be the cheaper and much better long-lasting service if you do have regular leakages.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is extensively pictured. If you have reasonably difficult water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
