Whole-house repiping can certainly be a large undertaking, which is why the service is only performed when definitely essential.

<p>In supply of water systems, water is usually maintained at a significant pressure to allow water to stream from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure might stop working or be decreased when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an unexpectedly high demand on the water supply (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe might enable contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
