In the larger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be covered to lessen any scale growth or rust.

Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, typically restore after a lot of gallons of water have been softened. If you have an ever-changing water utilize schedule, such models are practical.</p>
