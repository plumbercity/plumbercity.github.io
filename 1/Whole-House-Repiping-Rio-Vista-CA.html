<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one must initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these aspects are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new sodium ions.</p>
