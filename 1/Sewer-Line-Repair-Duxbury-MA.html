<h3>Hot Water Heater Problems in Duxbury Massachusetts</h2>
<p>Many homeowners will notice a clog and right away reach for a bottle of store-bought, chemical drain cleaner. While this kind of chemical might do the job, it's really quite harmful to your pipes.

Lye is created to eat through blockages and dissolve them, however it also penetrates your pipes and creates vulnerable points that are prone to rupture.</p>
<p>If your pipes are older than these guidelines, it doesn't necessarily mean they need to be replaced. Well-maintained pipes may last longer, and badly preserved ones or those in locations with hard water (indicating it has high mineral content), may fail faster, states Passaic, N.J., plumber Joseph Gove, who supplied the life expectancy estimates.</p>
