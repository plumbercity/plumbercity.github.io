<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like material coated with favorably charged sodium ions.

The water flows through the unit while the resin launches its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
