<p>Caution: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on the majority of rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however for the most part it should be much less water.</p>
