<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not come back due to the fact that he had another visit. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>

<h3>Helpful Tips For Selecting A Reputable, Budget Friendly Plumber Lafayette LA</h3>
<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your house's equivalent of significant surgical treatment, it's really something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with frequently. When your water lines are repiped, it simply implies old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with brand-new pipes. We find that houses 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement. If you have an older house and are experiencing significant and frequent leaks, you could be in need of water line repiping. We find that repiping can in fact be the more affordable and much better long-lasting solution if you do have frequent leakages.</p>
