<p>When you drop something down your drain or when you clean out a few hairs from the tub, it may seem like only a small problem. However, your drain system plays a much more substantial part in your plumbing system than you might understand. Your drains are put in place to protect your pipes from becoming clogged with hair and other particles. Drain cleaning should be carried out regularly to prevent blockages and damage to your plumbing system. At Paul's Plumbing & Heating, Inc., we offer an extensive list of Santa Fe drain repair services for your home.</p>
<p>Depending upon the degree of the clog, we might utilize a variety of different approaches, the most common being hydro-jetting. Hydro-jetting is an innovative kind of drain cleaning where we use water under high pressure to totally clear out everything inside your drains. Lay the garbage disposal on its side and eliminate the electrical cover plate from the bottom. Loosen the green ground screw and eliminate wire adapters. Detach waste disposal unit wires from electrical supply wires. Loosen screws on the electrical clamp connector and get rid of wires from the waste disposal unit.</p>
<p>It's not a requirement, but a waste disposal unit will make life in your Chicago area house easier. Sending scraps of food down the drain produces quicker clean up after meals and less (potentially smelly) waste in your trash can. When you have actually used it for a couple of days, the advantages of adding a garbage disposal to your kitchen sink will be apparent.</p>
