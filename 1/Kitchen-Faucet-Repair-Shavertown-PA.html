<p>The normal service is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an option to think about if you reside in an older house - such as one built pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for numerous years, but steel eventually struggles with deterioration and does not have the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
