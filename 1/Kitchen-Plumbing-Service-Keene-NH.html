Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity.
