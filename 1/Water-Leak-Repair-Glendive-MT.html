Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity.
