<p>Installed under the sink, the waste disposal unit is suggested for slicing up smidgens of waste food.

You must constantly run water while utilizing the waste disposal unit; when the garbage disposal does its task, the water flushes the carefully sliced particles down the drain.</p>

<p>Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses defense of the drinkable supply of water within a structure these devices are known as isolation" BFP. Once again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to guarantee there is an air gap, if there is no way to supply one, then we check to see that the correct BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be evaluated (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months thereafter.</p>

If not-- or if there is no disposal currently in place-- start by removing the old drain. Many drains are connected to the sink by a large nut underneath the sink that can be turned counter-clockwise to loosen up.</p>
