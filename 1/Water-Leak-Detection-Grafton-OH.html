<h3>Residential Plumbing Services Grafton OH</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, cable television or drain auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself job. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
