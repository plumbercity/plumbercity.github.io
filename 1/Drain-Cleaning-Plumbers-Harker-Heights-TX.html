<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have moderately hard water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
