<p>Your disposer may come with a thin rubber gasket to be used under the sink flange, rather of the standard plumber's putty as outlined below. Both will create an excellent seal (though the gasket might result in small amounts of water gathering around the flange), and what's utilized is largely a matter of choice.

When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
