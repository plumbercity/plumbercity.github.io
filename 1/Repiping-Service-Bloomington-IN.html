Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's probably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
