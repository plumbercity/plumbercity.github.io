<p>You notice rust in your water: If you begin to observe rust in your water, it might be an indication that you need pipe repair or drain repair services. Rust typically permeates into the water system when pipes have actually ended up being corroded. Although rust isn't inherently dangerous for your health, it can be a sign of trouble to come.
