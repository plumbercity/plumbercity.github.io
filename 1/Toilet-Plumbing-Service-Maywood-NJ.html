<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
