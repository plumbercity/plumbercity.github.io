<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection requests. No warm water in your house? Is your water taking too long to heat up? Is your water heater making noises, or do you see rusty colored water in your house? If you have any of these concerns, your water heater may need maintenance, repairs or perhaps a replacement. While some of these problems can be attributed to normal wear and tear or improper installation, in some cases your waste disposal unit becomes harmed by products that should not be run through it.</p>

Backflow defense is required on all types for sprinkler systems. While it may be more necessary on larger more complex systems, it is still indispensable protection on even the most basis setups.

<p>For instance, backflow can happen when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for usage.
