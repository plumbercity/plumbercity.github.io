Water pressure might stop working or be reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an all of a sudden high demand on the water supply (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe might allow infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
