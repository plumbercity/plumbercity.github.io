<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies Holiday FL</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Soft water is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, even throughout regrowth. Running toilets can be the result of a corroded overflow pipe, worn flush valve assembly, or broken flapper valve. Give the professionals at Roto-Rooter a call to repair your running toilet and minimize wasted water.
