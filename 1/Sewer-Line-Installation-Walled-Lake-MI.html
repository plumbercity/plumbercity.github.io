<p>Thank you a lot for taking the initiative to repair our water softener. over the holidays.

For a plumber specializing in drain-clearing services, anticipate to pay at least $70 per hour for drain lines and $125 per hour for sewer lines. Many problems can be fixed in an hour. For weekend or night calls, add more to the hourly rate.</p>
<p>Rust: The most common issue is rust in the tank and pipes that link to your water heater. This is particularly real if you have without treatment tough water, which includes severe minerals that can connect to the piping and tank and break down the material over time. Whether it's calcium, iron, or another component that is triggering the rust, you will eventually experience a leak in your water heater that is tough to repair.
