<p>Sewer lines have one essential function: bring wastewater out of a house or building. Although these house owners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was definitely great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in sufficient shape to reline prior to the problem worsened. Waiting simply wasn't a choice. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a removed garage. At the least, it would have been an extremely costly option.</p>
<p>Examine to ensure it's not your garbage disposal that's triggering the problem. A clogged disposal can stop up the drain, so run the disposal to see if that clears the clog.
