<p>Having a Specialist technician like one from Donelson Air Service Experts fix the problem and identify can help catch other parts that might will break.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return due to the fact that he had another appointment. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
