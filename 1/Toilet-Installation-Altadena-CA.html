<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Altadena CA 91001</h3>
<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of many repairs, there are a lot of other little toilet parts that ought to also be well preserved to help prevent leakages and other toilet problems. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to harden and split or merely be so squished that it doesn't fill the space along with it used to, and you end up with water all over the location. Just like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being so worn or corroded that they spring a leak. We strongly advise likewise changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in good shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>

<p>Tough water is triggered by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to eliminate these minerals. When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the solution by the salt ions.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits collect, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits occur more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
