While NFPA recognizes that backflow remains a legitimate health concern, it considers avoiding it outside the scope of NFPA 25. Rather, NFPA presumes that local or state requirements will guarantee that backflow preventers are appropriately evaluated by certified personnel.</p>

The results of elevated temperature can also trigger extreme pressure conditions which might damage the parts in the elements. These and other unfavorable impacts from the hydraulic conditions need to be acknowledged and their cause fixed. The brand-new parts can quickly be made inoperative if parts are replaced and the hydraulic conditions are not remedied.</p>
