<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly envisioned. If you have reasonably hard water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
