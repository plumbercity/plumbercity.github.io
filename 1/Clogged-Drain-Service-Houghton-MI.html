<p>Likewise, if you have a 2-story house, it'll be more costly to repipe since the plumber will need to browse through walls to do the task. Repiping plumbing lines in your house is a huge task - and it's a job you want to get right. However the range of plumbing pipe materials to select from can make it complicated.

<p>Once the FutureSoft water softener system is installed, depending on the age of your house and the plumbing will depend on what you will see. It might a couple of weeks to totally repipe your entire house if you have a huge home and don't employ sufficient contractors. We highly suggest repiping your home during spring or summer so you do not have to worry about freezing temperature levels throughout the repiping process if you live in a cold-weather environment.</p>
<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years old and you need to work with a plumber for that burner kit. The total repair bill might be in the $300 range. A gas hot water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair costs is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Choose the brand-new heater.</p>
