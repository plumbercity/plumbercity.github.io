<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is extensively thought of. If you have reasonably tough water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
