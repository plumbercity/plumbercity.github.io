<p>Difficult water is brought on by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to remove these minerals. When the water is available in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the service by the sodium ions.</p>
<p>Longstanding Clogs: Obstructions that continue after you have actually tried to repair them call for professional assistance.
