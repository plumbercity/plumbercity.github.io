<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Sahuarita AZ</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, snake or cable television auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY job. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
