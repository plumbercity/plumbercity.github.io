Things aggravate significantly for households with a high demand for warm water. The reasons for the noises can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which ought to be flushed to restore normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has actually been flushed, a water heater replacement may be required.</p>
