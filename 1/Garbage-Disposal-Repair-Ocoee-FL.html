<p>Caution: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on many rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump turns off. This is since the pressure variations brought on by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however in many cases it need to be much less water.</p>
<p>Thermostat Issues: The thermostat manages the water heater. You may lose control of the heating or cooling capacity of the unit if this part breakdowns.
