Disposers can be dropped in their tracks by celery, eggshells and apple seeds, in addition to the typical kitchen flotsam, including pop-tabs, searching pads and twist-ties. While some older houses might not have backflow preventers, all newer properties are needed to have them.

In those cases, an RPZ assembly is suggested.</p>
