WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
