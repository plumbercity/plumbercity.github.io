<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively envisioned.

That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
