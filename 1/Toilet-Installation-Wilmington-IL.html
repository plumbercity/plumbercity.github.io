<p>Your sewer line is among the most important parts of your household plumbing - and if it ends up being damaged or clogged, it might wreak unwanted issues on your property. A home's service line (also referred to as a sewer lateral) runs from the house to the mainline sewer in the street. In most cases, the property owner is accountable for maintaining the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is accountable for preserving the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>Retail prices for house water softeners might vary from roughly $400 to $2,700, depending on the size and type of softener. Softeners are ranked by the overall number of grains the unit can eliminate prior to being charged.
