Repeating leaks and repairs.

As an outcome, we advise changing your unit if it is over ten years old.</p>
<p>Replacing your flapper may require slightly various actions than we reveal (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job if you have an unusual flush valve. To find an appropriate replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Turn off the water prior to eliminating the flapper.) You might not find a similar match, but opportunities are you'll locate one of the same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
