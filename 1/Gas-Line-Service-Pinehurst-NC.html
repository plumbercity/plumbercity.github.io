When your water lines are repiped, it just means old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We discover that homes 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement. If you have an older house and are experiencing significant and frequent leakages, you could be in need of water line repiping. We find that repiping can really be the less expensive and better long-lasting option if you do have regular leaks.</p>
