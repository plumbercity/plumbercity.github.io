<p>Passive Purge - As much as 2007, some houses were permitted to bypass a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with use of several toilets in the home. Usually, the water system to among the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire lawn sprinkler; upon each use, fresh water was presented into the fire lawn sprinkler.</p>
