<p>If the water heater leakages or burst, high water pressure also leads to thermal expansion in water heaters which can lead to possible water damage. The more of these components you have, the more costly the task will be.

Changing the pipes for many plumbing fixtures requires more labor and pipe, which increases cost.</p>
<p>Oregon state laws governing water systems require backflow prevention assemblies to be set up on water services where cross connections can not be eliminated.
