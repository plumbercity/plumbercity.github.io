<p>Leakages are sneaky. With time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften difficult water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a focused quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, providing the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>A testable backflow prevention device has two check valves-- basically two layers of protection. The device permits water to press the check valves open when water is entering into the building, but closes them shut when water attempts to go the incorrect way. There are 2 different types of testable backflow prevention gadgets that are frequently specified-- a lowered pressure zone backflow device and a check backflow device. There are a few others that I will discuss however do not get hung up on them. I discuss them only since they will be on an accreditation test.</p>
