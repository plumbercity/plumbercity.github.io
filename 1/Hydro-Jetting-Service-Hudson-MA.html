Constant feed disposals are easy to run: you run water in the kitchen sink, turn a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this kind of garbage disposal, nevertheless, bottle caps, silverware, and other metal debris can sometimes get caught in the blades. This can damage the blades and require repairs.</p>

As a bathroom drain is likewise more difficult to replace and repair than a kitchen sink drain, it's more likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
