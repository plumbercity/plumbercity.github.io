For double-bowl sinks, the very best way to set about things is to use a constant waste disposer set including a discharge tube, baffle tee, and tailpiece. Such packages direct both drains to a single trap. Depending on the place of the stub out, you'll need either an end outlet or center outlet package.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes without any neighboring utilities or blockages, digging through and changing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or pathways, dig-free pipe lining could save you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a bucket under the P-trap and disconnect the drainpipes. Then remove the sink strainer. Get rid of any excess putty.</p>
