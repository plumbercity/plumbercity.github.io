<p>In some communities, home water softeners drain to municipal wastewater treatment plants, which are not designed to eliminate chloride. The chloride passes through the treatment plant and ends up in our streams and lakes. In houses with personal wells and home softeners, chloride drains to the home's septic system and then winds up in lakes and streams.</p>
<p>You have actually probably seen drain cleaner items on the shelves at your local home improvement shop, so when your drain gets clogged or isn't draining water like it should, you may be lured to head down there and choose some approximately fix it by yourself. These items, after all, make the process seem pretty basic. Sadly it's not as simple as you may think, and those products are not necessarily going to fix the issue. In most cases it's more helpful to work with a professional plumber in Utah.</p>
<p>The space under your kitchen sink has gotten more crowded throughout the years.
