<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers and that may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not come back because he had another consultation. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another technique is to introduce a chemical substance that functions as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and remain suspended in the water instead of building up on surfaces. Nevertheless, if they stay in one location for long, as they may in a hot water heater, the accumulation could still take place.</p>
