You can keep odors away by grinding up orange or lemon peels inside it. More difficult products, like eggshells and fish bones, search the disposal walls and assist keep them clean as well.

<p>The discharge tube consisted of in the disposer package will be attached to the disposer utilizing the plate, gasket and screws initially meant for the disposer discharge elbow. If your package only includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The consecutive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can lead to improper drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you might be able to cut off its elbow and use the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
