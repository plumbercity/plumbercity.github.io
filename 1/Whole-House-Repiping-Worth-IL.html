<h3>Safe Alternatives In Fixing A Blocked Drain in Worth IL 60482</h3>
<p>A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Rather than dislodging the obstruction with negative pressure, it in fact presses into the obstruction, working further into where the blockage is occurring. The auger or snake" is then utilized to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to stream easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped suggestion helps require it further down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>
