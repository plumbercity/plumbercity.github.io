He detected the issue and was able to return and jet it out. Saved me the time and cash of ripping everything out and replacing it. He offered suggestions to help in the future, was really professional, and will be used again if need be. Extremely advised.</p>
<p>Insecticide from garden pipes: The extremely poisonous insecticide chlordane was back-siphoned into the water supply. An extermination company worker had left one end of a garden hose in a barrel of diluted insecticide and the other connected to an external home hose bibb (outside spigot).
