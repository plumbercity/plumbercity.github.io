Rather than dislodging the obstruction with negative pressure, it actually pushes into the clog, working further into where the blockage is occurring.

The auger's corkscrew-shaped idea assists require it further down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>
<p>Responsive circulation technology works by continuously bringing tanks on-line and off-line in reaction to the water demands of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, only one of the four tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. However, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill. This responsive style permits the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than standard single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
