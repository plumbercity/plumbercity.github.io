Some components might have really tight tolerances that need to be kept. A crucial thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is a very important part of the style of each part. If the part is not repaired appropriately, the guide might limit the motion (instead of constant or direct) of the part, which could trigger the part to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
