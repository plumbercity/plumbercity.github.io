<h3>Modern Water Leak Detection Technique in Dawsonville GA 30534</h3>
<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- destructive. For this reason, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this type of deterioration A softener is simply capturing some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (normally sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
