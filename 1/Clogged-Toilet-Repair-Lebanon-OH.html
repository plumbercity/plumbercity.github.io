Once again, the very best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air gap, if there is no chance to provide one, then we examine to see that the appropriate BFP device is installed.

<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on specific new sinks, however these will be labeled to that effect. If you can't utilize plumber's putty, use a non-water-based silicone. Excess putty will eject between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in location. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Ensure to place the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
<p>The average time to replace a garbage or install disposal varies from 2 to 3 hours. A handyman charges $25 and $45 per hour while plumbers charge $45 and $100 per hour.
