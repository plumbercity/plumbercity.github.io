<p>Disadvantages to be knowledgeable about is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that remains between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well.

Also, hybrids need as much as 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to catch adequate heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to discharge the condensate.</p>

<p>Pro Idea: If you're going to be draining a dishwasher through the unit, now is the best time to remove the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet.

This is also the perfect time to make the connections for a hardwired system with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
