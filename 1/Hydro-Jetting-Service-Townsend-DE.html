If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>Examples of backflow conditions include backsiphonage and back pressure. Early diagnosis and repair can save your plumbing system from unnecessary blockages even more down the water lines. In some circumstances, resins can not be washed of pollutants and will need to be replaced. (This ought to not be the case if the resin is regularly regenerated and preserved.)
