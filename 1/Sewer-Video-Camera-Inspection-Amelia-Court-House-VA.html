<p>A lot of houses or buildings that were built in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather condition protection. As the external finish of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
