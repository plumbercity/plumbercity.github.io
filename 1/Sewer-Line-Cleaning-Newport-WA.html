<p>Some homeowners might think about water softeners as a luxury product, something that's nice to have" but not altogether required. However, hard water can cause everything from small inconveniences, like spots on meals or soap scum, to significant problems like a much shorter life-span for your hot water heater, dishwasher, and other necessary home devices.
