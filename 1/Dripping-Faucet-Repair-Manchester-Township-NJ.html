<p>Without a water softener, laundry needs additional detergent to prevent it from looking dingy. Dishes will come out of your dishwasher streaked and stained. Filmy scum builds up on your shower drapes and your soap and shampoo will not lather. Bathing in hard water leaves your skin itchy and dry and your hair sticky and lifeless. The large quantity of money, time, and energy required to tidy up the harmful adverse effects of tough water is excessive. A whole house water softener is the option to the scourge of water hardness.</p>
