Is your hot water heater making sounds, or do you see rusty colored water in your home? If you have any of these concerns, your water heater might need maintenance, repairs and even a replacement. While some of these issues can be credited to normal wear and tear or inappropriate installation, in some cases your garbage disposal becomes harmed by products that should not be gone through it.</p>

However, when hair, food scraps, feminine hygiene products, toys, and other foreign objects make their method into your drains, they can cause major problems. While in some cases it's obvious you need drain cleaning (when your bathroom sink is entirely stopped-up, or there's gurgling in your kitchen drains, for instance), it can in some cases be harder to tell if you have a problem on your hands.</p>
<p>Foul Sewer Smell: Among the first most apparent indications of a sewer problem is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the lawn (in the area where your sewer line would be).

Even if the issue comes from with the local system, it's still smart to bring in the professionals to restrict the damage to your home.</p>
