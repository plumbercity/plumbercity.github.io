The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and are good for back siphonage only for non-health danger or health danger conditions. They need to be set up downstream from any shut off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. , if an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on an irrigation system you need to install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.. It should also be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local officials, need that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the greatest outlet). Some municipalities do not enable the usage of GFAVB's. These units will NOT avoid backflow pressure and can only safeguard against back siphonage.</p>
