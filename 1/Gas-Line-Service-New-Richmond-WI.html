<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that permits water to go through it in one direction, however avoids it from going backwards in the opposite instructions. You may be familiar with galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, simply put, the very same thing, but without the zinc finishing. The zinc covering on galvanized pipe for gas is implied to keep the pipe from corroding from contact with moisture. While it does its task pretty well, over time, it still does wear away. This allows the toilet to flush. A plumber will charge $135 to fix it.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Inspect spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction throughout the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
