<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
