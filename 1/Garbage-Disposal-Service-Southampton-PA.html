<p>Ensuring plumbing equipment such as sprinkler systems and fire pumps are isolated to their own respective networks is necessary in order to protect safe and clean water safety. When buying a home or flat, having a plumbing inspection is quite basic. If it's a leasing I have actually not seen a plumbing inspection done.  Again I have actually not seen electrical take any sort of precidence over plumbing. In truth, if not done it can be among the most pricey repair tasks if ignored. For example, if your water piping is galvanized pipe and pressure is an issue, you might need all of your water piping replaced. Again, extremely pricey.
