<p>We're changing a natural gas hot water heater in our presentation. The steps for replacing a lp water heater are exactly the very same, and those for an electric water heater are similar. Repeating leakages and repairs.

As an outcome, we recommend changing your system if it is over ten years old.</p>
<p>Pull the 2 lines out of the trimmer, one at a time. Dispose of the damaged fuel lines. When you pull the fuel lines from the trimmer, a small round fuel line filter will pop off the thin line leading into the tank.
