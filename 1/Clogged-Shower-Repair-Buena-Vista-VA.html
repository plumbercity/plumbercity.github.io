<p>When compared to gas models, electrical designs are easier and less expensive to install as electrical energy is already available through the main power supply line. For gas water heaters, a specific gas line has to be set up and a practical source of gas established. Another feature of an electric water heater is that they do not need any ventilation.

<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the salt exchange websites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
