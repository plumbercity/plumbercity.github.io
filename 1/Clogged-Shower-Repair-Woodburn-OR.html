<h3>Ensure Your Kitchen Sink Stays Unclogged With Three Easy Steps in Woodburn OR 97071</h3>
<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the actual ion exchange, or water softening, takes place. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the salt, or salt, is stored and combined with water. , if you prepare to drain your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate undamaged if you will not use your system to drain a dishwasher.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product coated with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water flows through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
