<h3>24 Hour Plumber & Water Heater Services Lindenhurst NY</h3>
<p>Most houses or buildings that were built in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather condition protection. As the outer finish of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>This post intends to resolve the common misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes rust This is not the case: a correctly set up water softener does not make the treated water more destructive. Here are a couple of complicated facts that often lead individuals to this erroneous conclusion. First, naturally soft water is normally corrosive. Therefore, softened water must also be corrosive, right? This is a fallacy due to the fact that naturally soft water tends to be destructive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening causes neither of these conditions.</p>
