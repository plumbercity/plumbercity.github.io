<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your home then leave into the sewer or septic system from your home. When you experience blockages in several drains simultaneously in your house, then that usually implies that your main sewer line is backing up. This can happen in several locations and any mix of drains. For example, water might fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are a number of combinations of this type of backup. The point is your drains all link, and when you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from several drain lines in your house.</p>

This is also the perfect time to make the connections for a hardwired unit with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
