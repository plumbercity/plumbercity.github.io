<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components might have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An important thing to determine on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is an extremely vital part of the design of each element. If the component is not repaired effectively, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than consistent or direct) of the part, which could trigger the part to not work to its abilities.

In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
