<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Cleveland OH 44130</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one need to initially consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these aspects are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
