<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler generally are set up in areas where water could cause devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer spaces, and areas with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system.
