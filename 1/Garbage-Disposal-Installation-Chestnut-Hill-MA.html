<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer package will be attached to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally intended for the disposer discharge elbow. If your kit just includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not suggested - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint. The successive 90 ° turns in such a setup can lead to improper drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you might be able to cut off its elbow and utilize the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
