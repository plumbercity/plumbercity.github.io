In many cases, the property owner is accountable for preserving the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is responsible for preserving the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>Debris such as foreign objects - Things such as soap, hair, food and even little toys can become lodged in between your drainpipe and your pipes.

Also, if too much toilet tissue is flushed down your toilet, or hygienic products are flushed, a clog can take place.

<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer package will be attached to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally intended for the disposer discharge elbow. If your kit just includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not suggested - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint. The successive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can lead to improper drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you might be able to cut off its elbow and utilize the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
