Then, a new mounting ring is installed to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is linked, and the disposal is hooked up to its mount. In this method, water is treated with a calculated quantity of washing soda (Na2CO3) which converts the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their particular carbonates which get precipitated.</p>
