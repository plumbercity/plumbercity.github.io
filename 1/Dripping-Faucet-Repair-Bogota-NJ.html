<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must first consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these components are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
