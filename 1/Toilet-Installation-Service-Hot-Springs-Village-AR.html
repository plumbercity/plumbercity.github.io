<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc attached to a climatic vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outdoors air. This triggers the disc to open, enabling air to go into the valve and restore pressure comparable to ambient atmospheric standard. This repair of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>

If you plan to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1).
