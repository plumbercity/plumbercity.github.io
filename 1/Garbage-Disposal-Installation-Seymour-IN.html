The largest of these main long-distance transmitting pipes are referred to as aqueducts. Usually built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe sections, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable finishing, these are huge underground and aboveground pipes created to bring bulk flow quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and distribution nodes where the flows are transferred to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. Most big cities need several aqueducts providing water from diverse and geographically separated sources.</p>

<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from regular circulation direction within a piping system that is caused by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of typical circulation in a system brought on by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the supply of water piping). Back-siphonage can take place when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is decreased main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>

<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming potable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
