<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been gotten rid of-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this type of corrosion A softener is just capturing some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (typically sodium or often potassium).</p>
<p>Backflow preventers not conforming to these guidelines for an offered application and which are broken or broken and require replacement must be changed by a backflow preventer which does comply to the guidelines for the given application.
