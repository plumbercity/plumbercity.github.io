<p>Video cameras are one of the most valuable tools in the plumbing organisation. Determine the size of the pipes in the home and around the house - they will help to figure out the water pressure that you'll have. For water pressure to be sufficient, the lines need to be 3/4" to one inch directly from the main water source for the home. The pipes themselves must be at least a 1/2" in size to supply appropriate flow.</p>
<p>Re-piping is a process of replacing the supply pipes in a home or company. It is not a temporary fix or a replacement of short sections of pipe, but a total replacement of your supply plumbing system. There are numerous reasons you may need to repipe your house or service.

If you are going to renovate it is a great time to repipe prior to you paint or complete your walls.  It is essential to comprehend the scope of the project prior to work is begun.
