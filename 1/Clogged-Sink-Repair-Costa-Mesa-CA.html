<h3>How Often Should Plumbing Check Costa Mesa CA</h3>
<p>A newly set up hot water heater should not produce unusual sounds, but it will start to produce rumbling noises as it ages. The noises get louder gradually as the heater goes to heat up the water. Things get worse dramatically for households with a high demand for warm water. The reasons for the sounds can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which ought to be flushed to bring back normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has been flushed, a water heater replacement might be necessary.</p>
