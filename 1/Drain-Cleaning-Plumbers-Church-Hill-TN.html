<p>Manual leak detection for drainage applications is the simplest of the three offered approaches. There are not enough words that I can use to express how awesome this team is. From getting a new hot water heater when I first moved in, to showing up at 10pm due to the fact that a pipe busted in my tub and I had water permeating through my lights. These men are truly the very best. Excellent prices, everybody I have had the satisfaction of working with has been so kind and responsive also I highly suggest utilizing their services.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Inspect spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction throughout the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
