<p>Maintenance or replacement, you can anticipate professional service from proficient plumbing specialists when you rely on Roto-Rooter for water heater repair. Backflow prevention devices run by enabling water to stream in only one direction. In an unguarded water service connection, potable water can stream both in and out of a structure or fixture. When water service is disrupted in the street or in a structure for any factor, there is a pressure drop which can draw infected water backwards into the water supply. For example, cleaning fluids might be drawn back from car washes; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler might go into the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water supply from air conditioning cooling towers; and chemicals from medical clinic's X-ray development might stream in reverse into the drinkable water system. To secure water quality, backflow defense is needed where the end user presents a threat of contaminating the city's water system.</p>

<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor North Andover MA</h3>
<p>Professional drain cleaning and plumbing blockage service may seem like a waste of money. Why buy professional drain repair service when a chemical drain cleaner will work? While chemical drain cleaners might be an inexpensive option, the severe components rust your inner drain pipe, over time, producing weak spots in the pipe that are most likely to burst. Handling repairing a burst pipe is certainly not worth the savings incurred from utilizing a chemical drain cleaner.</p>
<p>Seeing high water pressure at plumbing components in your home? Water pressure in the home is similar to blood pressure in the body - it needs to be managed to keep the system healthy. When unregulated water pressure triggers damage to the plumbing system, this can lead to emergency plumbing calls, like flooding. Having a water pressure regulator set up is A LOT MORE economical than mold remediation or changing flooring or drywall! So we suggest setting up or repairing water pressure regulators to protect your entire home.</p>
