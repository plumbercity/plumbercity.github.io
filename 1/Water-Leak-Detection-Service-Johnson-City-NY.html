<p>This is another combination that can deal with sink blockages. Mix about a cup of baking soda with a half-cup of salt, and put down the drain. Let the mix sit for numerous hours, then flush with boiling water. You can repeat this process if it does not work the first time. Galvanized steel pipes are ideal for irrigation and water system lines, but they are generally not used in new constructions today. It is more likely to be found in older houses constructed before the 1970s.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems typically are installed in large, unheated areas, such as parking garages. These systems have actually pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed.
