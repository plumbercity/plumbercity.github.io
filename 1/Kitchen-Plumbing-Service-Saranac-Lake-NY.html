<p>Leakages are sly. In time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capacity to soften tough water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, offering the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
