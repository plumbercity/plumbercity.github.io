<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler typically are installed in areas where water might trigger disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and areas with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
