<p>How to install or replace a garbage disposal. Regular drain inspections and cleanings are recommended every 3 years or two. Appropriate maintenance is essential to extending the life of your pipe system. Relying on drain cleaners purchased the store can actually hurt your pipes. This is why professional drain cleaning is advised to ensure that your pipes are maintained using the best techniques.</p>
<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water boiler, heater, and dishwasher, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits. At first, these small deposits are safe, but over time they build up and ultimately clog pipes, seize valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can considerably restrict the water flow, which puts undue pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>
