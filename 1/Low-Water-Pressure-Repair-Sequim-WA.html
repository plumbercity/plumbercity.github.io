<p>For shallow pipes without any close-by utilities or blockages, digging through and changing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or pathways, dig-free pipe lining could save you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more. Set a bucket under the P-trap and disconnect the drains. Then eliminate the sink strainer. Get rid of any excess putty.</p>
