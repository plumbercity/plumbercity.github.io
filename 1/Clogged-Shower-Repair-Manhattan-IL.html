This device includes no less than five individually operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves).

The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if pricey) device is best used in vital areas where cross contamination might be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
