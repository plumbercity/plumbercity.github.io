Again I have not seen electrical take any sort of precidence over plumbing. In truth, if not done it can be among the most pricey repair jobs if overlooked. For example, if your water piping is galvanized pipe and pressure is a concern, you might need all of your water piping changed. Once again, very expensive. This is just one of many concerns that can crop up.</p>
