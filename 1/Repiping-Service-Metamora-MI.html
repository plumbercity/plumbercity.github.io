<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from normal circulation direction within a piping system that is triggered by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of typical circulation in a system caused by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water system piping). Back-siphonage can happen when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is reduced main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
