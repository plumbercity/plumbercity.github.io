Once again I have not seen electrical take any sort of precidence over plumbing. In truth, if not done it can be among the most expensive repair projects if overlooked.

<p>Debris such as foreign items - Items such as soap, hair, food and even little toys can end up being trapped between your drainpipe and your pipes. These will eventually obstruct the circulation of your water prior to causing a clog. Likewise, if too much bathroom tissue is flushed down your toilet, or hygienic items are flushed, a clog can occur. Thermostat issues: The thermostat controls the temperature of the water heater. You might be left with water that is scalding hot or freezing cold if this part malfunctions.</p>
