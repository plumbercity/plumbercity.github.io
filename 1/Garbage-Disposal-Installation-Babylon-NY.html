<p>Physical strength. Steamfitters, plumbers, and pipefitters must have the ability to lift and move heavy tools and materials. Idea: Location a heavy things such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation. Loosen up the clamp and eliminate the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal.
