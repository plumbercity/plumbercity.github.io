<p>Water that has been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- destructive. For this reason, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this kind of corrosion A softener is merely recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (typically salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
<p>A Pilot burner That Has Gone Out: If you are not getting any warm water at all, and you use a gas water heater rather than a system with an electric heating aspect, there is a likelihood your pilot burner has gone out. This could be because of a problem with your thermocouple, a lack of combustible air, or merely a strong breeze. Regardless of what the problem is, however, your water heater will not have the ability to function till the pilot burner is re-lit.</p>
