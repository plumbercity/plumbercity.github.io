<p>It is essential to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt an effectively functioning RPZ assembly to periodically release small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be installed in areas subject to water damage. Appropriate drainage must likewise be provided.</p>
