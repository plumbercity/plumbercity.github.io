<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite affordable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very happy with their service.</p>
