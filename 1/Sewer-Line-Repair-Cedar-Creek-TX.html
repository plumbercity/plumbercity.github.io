<p>Is your drain clogged with toilet, debris, or hair paper? After years of usage, drains can collect damaging accumulation.

In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This activates the disc to open, enabling air to go into the valve and restore pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric requirement. This repair of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
