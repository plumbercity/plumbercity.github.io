<p>Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water features must have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. These water functions are considered a health risk if backflows occur from them. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and area need to be shown on building and construction strategies. Any backflow preventer set up on a fountain or garden pond should be checked upon installation and then yearly.</p>
<p>decreased pressure concept assemblies: These are commonly used in plants, healthcare facilities, morgues, chemical plants, irrigation systems, boilers, and fire lawn sprinkler. Minimized pressure principle assemblies (RPs) secure against back-pressure and back-siphonage of contaminants and pollutants. The assembly is comprised of two internally filled, individually operating check valves with a mechanically independent, hydraulically dependent relief valve between them.</p>
<p>Testing should be completed by a contractor registered with the Cross Connection Control office. The contractor needs to have a valid, up-to-date plumbing license, current insurance coverage, backflow preventer testing accreditation, and currently calibrated test kit. For testing of fireline backflow preventers, the State's Fire Marshal certificate is required.</p>
