Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most typical metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping. Although all these products are resilient in the short-term, they degrade over years. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are prone to many different types of rust. After about fifty years, they'll begin to damage from deterioration and might position toxic substances into the freshwater supply. We suggest changing the clay, iron, and steel pipes in your home.
