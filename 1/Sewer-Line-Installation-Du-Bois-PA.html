<p>Your home's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not truly the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>
<p>Leaky faucets and clogged drains are the most common sink repair problems. Typical enough that lots of people go for do-it-yourself repairs. But often even recognizing the leak can be a problem. It could be the shutoff valve, the faucet, a spray hose, waste disposal unit fittings, the edge of the sink itself, or any part of the drain-- tailpiece, extension tube, slip extension, elbows, T joints, or the U or J trap.</p>
<p>If you have your water checked, the report will use one or both of these units to tell you how difficult your water is.
