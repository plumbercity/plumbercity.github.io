<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, a range of materials were utilized for home plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping. Although all these materials are durable in the short-term, they weaken over years.

We recommend replacing the iron, clay, and steel pipes in your house.

<p>Many plumbers will eliminate the old system to install the brand-new one at the exact same hourly rate.

In those cases, an RPZ assembly is recommended.</p>
