<p>For shallow pipes without any neighboring energies or blockages, digging through and replacing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally.

Set a bucket under the P-trap and disconnect the drains. Then get rid of the sink strainer. Eliminate any excess putty.</p>
