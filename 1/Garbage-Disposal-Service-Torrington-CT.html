<p>Passive Purge - Approximately 2007, some homes were enabled to bypass a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with use of several toilets in the home. Usually, the water system to among the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire sprinkler system; upon each use, fresh water was introduced into the fire sprinkler system.</p>
