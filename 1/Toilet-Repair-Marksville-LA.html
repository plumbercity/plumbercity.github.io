<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Normally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in sodium is small, but if you've been advised by a physician to follow a stringent low sodium diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>
