<p>Leak detection is a component of water conservation that depends on extremely technical expertise and specific devices to recognize the place of leaks throughout the city's water distribution system and determine the location of those leakages at which noticeable water may or might not have actually surfaced.

House owners can just loosen the aerator screen from the faucet to clean out minerals or other deposits. Water pressure can likewise be low if the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way.</p>
