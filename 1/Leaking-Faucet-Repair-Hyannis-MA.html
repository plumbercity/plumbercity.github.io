<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one need to initially think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these components are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
