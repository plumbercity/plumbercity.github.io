<p>Camera are one of the most important tools in the plumbing business.

The pipes themselves must be at least a 1/2" in diameter to provide adequate circulation.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Lowered Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is minimized by the # 1 Inspect spring (for example, to 90 psi).

If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
