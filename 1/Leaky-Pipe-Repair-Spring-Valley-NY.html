<p>Every reasonable buyer checks a minimum of numerous things before making a down payment on a house. As you might understand that the water quality here is quite bad. But are you aware simply how bad? Most of the Valley in fact has a few of the worst water in the nation. We rank 3rd for the absolute worst water in the country according to DailyFinance and the Environmental Working Group. Having bad water comes naturally, we do live in a desert after all. In fact the water you shower with, brush your teeth, and even consume has a chlorine level that is perfect for pool. We have 300% more chemicals that exceed nationwide health guidelines, and a even high percentage of toxins in our water that the nationwide average. On top of that our typical water hardness level is between 18-23 grains per gallon of water or for simpleness reasons "extremely difficult water".</p>
<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
