<p>We specialize in tub and shower replacement and complete bathroom renovating at really competitive rates. Jams-- The disposal might end up being jammed with food or other items. We can clear jams and help clients understand what they must not put down their disposals. Just how much does it cost to repipe a home with PEX? About the exact same cost, although you'll likely pay more due to the fact that it's a more resilient, much better quality material. A great general rule is that you can anticipate to pay from 40 cents to $2.20 per-linear-foot to repipe a house.</p>
<p>To link a power cord to the brand-new system, remove the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and join the colored wires found inside with their equivalents in the cord, using wire nuts. The green ground wire is looped under the green screw on the unit. This can be done at any point prior to installation. Plumbing strategies are not required for one- and two-family houses or townhouses, as defined in the California Residential Code, and their accessory structures.</p>

<p>The technician, Kenny, was respectful, professional and informative! He asked me to look at the camera with him then discussed my options without attempting to oversell me!
