Constant feed disposals are simple to run: you run water in the kitchen sink, turn a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this kind of waste disposal unit, however, bottle caps, silverware, and other metal debris can often get captured in the blades. This can damage the blades and require repairs.</p>

Over time, dirt, debris, hair, and numerous other small particles can get trapped and build up in your pipes. Ultimately, the water may not have the ability to drain quickly or effectively, and you may experience water pooling in your bathroom sink or a toilet that is constantly backing up. It may be time to call on a professional from Atlas Plumbing to examine when this occurs.</p>
