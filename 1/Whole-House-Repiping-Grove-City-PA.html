<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection requests. No hot water in your home? Is your water taking too long to warm up? Is your hot water heater making noises, or do you see rusty colored water in your house? If you have any of these problems, your water heater may need maintenance, repairs and even a replacement. While a few of these problems can be attributed to typical wear and tear or inappropriate installation, often your waste disposal unit becomes harmed by items that shouldn't be run through it.</p>
