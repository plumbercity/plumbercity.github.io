<p>Organic particles, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains.

The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
