<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical solution is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an option to think about if you live in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for lots of years, but steel ultimately suffers from corrosion and lacks the resilience these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
