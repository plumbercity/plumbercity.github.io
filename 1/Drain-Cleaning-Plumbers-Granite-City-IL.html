<p>Changing your flapper might need a little different actions than we show (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an unusual flush valve, discovering a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job. To find an appropriate replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Shut off the water prior to removing the flapper.)
