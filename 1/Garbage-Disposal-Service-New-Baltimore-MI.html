<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to conquer osmotic pressure and remove water particles from the option with hardness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to confess water molecules for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is devoid of hardness ions without any other ions being included. Membranes are a kind of water filter requiring regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
