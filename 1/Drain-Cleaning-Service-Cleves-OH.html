<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection demands. No warm water in your house? Is your water taking too long to heat up? Is your hot water heater making noises, or do you see rusty colored water in your home? If you have any of these problems, your water heater may need maintenance, repairs and even a replacement. While a few of these problems can be credited to typical wear and tear or improper installation, in some cases your waste disposal unit becomes harmed by products that shouldn't be run through it.</p>
<p>To link a power cord to the new system, get rid of the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and join the colored wires discovered inside with their counterparts in the cord, using wire nuts. The green ground wire is looped under the green screw on the unit. This can be done at any point prior to installation. Plumbing plans are not required for one- and two-family residences or townhouses, as defined in the California Residential Code, and their accessory structures.</p>
