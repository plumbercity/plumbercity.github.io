<h3>Efficient Services Of Plumber Huntington NY</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable television, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY project. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
