<p>When the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair process. It is essential that the plumbing system be turned on really gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system.
