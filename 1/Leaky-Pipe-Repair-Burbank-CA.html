<p>Water softeners add worth to your operation by safeguarding your water-using devices from poor efficiency and premature failure. Some difficult water problems are very noticeable, like dispensers and sprayers becoming clogged. Other problems can go undetected, like scale on water heater aspects and buildup in reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Noticeable or invisible, these problems have actually genuine expenses associated with them. Clogged fixtures cause replacement or refurbishing costs and can annoy your consumers. Scale buildup in your hot water heater will inflate your energy expenses, and too soon harmed RO membranes will leave you with unneeded replacement expenses. Soon, these small costs can amount to make a real impact on your bottom line.</p>
<p>Water softening refers to the elimination of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular method of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. Throughout ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another type of ion-- normally sodium.
