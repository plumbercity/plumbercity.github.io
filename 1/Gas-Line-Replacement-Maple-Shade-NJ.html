<p>The LAGBC is based on the 2013 California Green Structure Standards Code, typically referred to as "CALGreen" that was established and mandated by the State to achieve consistency amongst the various jurisdictions within the State; lower the structure's energy and water usage; decrease waste; and reduce the carbon footprint. Continuous feed disposals are simple to run: you run water in the kitchen sink, turn a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this type of waste disposal unit, however, bottle caps, silverware, and other metal debris can often get captured in the blades. This can damage the blades and need repairs.</p>
<p>Any home appliance that uses water, from little coffee pots to large refrigerators, operates more effectively in a house with softened water. This is because there's no limescale buildup to disrupt moving heat or clogging pipes. Enhanced effectiveness likewise indicates that you'll enjoy a decline in your energy costs, as your appliances will not need to work harder or use more water in order to function at their best.</p>
