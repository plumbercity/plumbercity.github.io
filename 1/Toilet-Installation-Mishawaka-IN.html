If an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on a watering system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It needs to also be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local authorities, require that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the highest outlet). Some towns do not enable the usage of GFAVB's. These units will NOT avoid backflow pressure and can only secure versus back siphonage.</p>
