<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements might have extremely tight tolerances that need to be preserved. An important thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is a very critical part of the design of each element. If the component is not repaired correctly, the guide might limit the motion (rather than consistent or direct) of the part, which might trigger the part to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part triggering lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
