<p>2 - This action minimizes calcium, magnesium, carbonate firmness, sulfate, nitrate and chloride, where CO2 forms as reaction product, which is removed from the water in the downstream degasifier (2 ).

<p>Setting up a brand-new gas line in the kitchen will typically range from $300 to $800 depending on the length of the pipe needed.

<p>Plainly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the salt exchange websites are changed with firmness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use as soon as backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
