<p>Safeguard your home from leakages. There are several things that you must consider to assist you decide when you need a water heater replacement. A great basic general rule is that as soon as your present hot water heater reaches its 10th birthday, you must begin getting ready for a replacement.

For instance, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This eliminates the need for a backflow preventer, because each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
