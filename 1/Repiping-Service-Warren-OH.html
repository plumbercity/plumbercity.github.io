Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line.
