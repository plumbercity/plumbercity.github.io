<h3>Water Heater Issues and Repair at Sharon PA 16146</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written price quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, because I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months ago. I feel that rates were increased due to the fact that I had a "Deal". An Angie's list article from March stated depending on the market and intensity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
<p>Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water features need to have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. These water features are thought about a health risk if backflows take place from them. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and place must be shown on construction plans. Any backflow preventer installed on a fountain or garden pond need to be tested upon installation and after that every year.</p>
