<p>Cold showers? High energy expenses? It might be time for a brand-new hot water heater.

A water heater that is not set up properly can lead to water damage, scalding temperatures, or even a fire.

The likelihood of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless most of the times it need to be much less water.</p>
