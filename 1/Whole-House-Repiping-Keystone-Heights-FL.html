<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing process includes a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made from a non-conductive material. Some softeners work on electrical energy, however some more current water softeners use waterpower. Expenses of a water softener significantly rely on the type of water softener and the type of energy that is utilized, however likewise upon the solidity of the water that needs softening and the water use. When the water is very difficult and it is used heavily, the costs of softening will increase.</p>

<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Normally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is minor, but if you have actually been recommended by a physician to follow a stringent low salt diet this boost can posture problems.</p>
