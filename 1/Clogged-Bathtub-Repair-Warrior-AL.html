Minimized Pressure Zone Assembly (RPZ) - the most costly backflow prevention alternative, RPZs are also the most reliable backflow preventers. They are safe to use with landscaping chemicals, making them perfect for usage with irrigation systems.</p>
<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water heater, dishwasher, and boiler, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits. At first, these little deposits are harmless, but over time they build up and eventually clog pipes, seize valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In severe cases, hard-water deposits can considerably limit the water flow, which puts unnecessary pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>

Again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air gap, if there is no chance to provide one, then we check to see that the proper BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be evaluated (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months afterwards.</p>
