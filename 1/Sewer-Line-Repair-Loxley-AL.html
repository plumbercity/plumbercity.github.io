<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use as soon as backwashing is total. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>Within commercial centers, DCV and RPZ backflow prevention systems need to be inspected, kept, and evaluated with consistency. Without constant testing and maintenance, these systems can permit infected water to stream freely within your supply pipes, developing a severe health threat to developing occupants. Each backflow prevention system requires different testing procedures and intervals, and needs considerable experience and understanding.</p>
