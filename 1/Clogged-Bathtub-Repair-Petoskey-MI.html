<h3>Gas Line Replacement in Petoskey Michigan</h2>

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return due to the fact that he had another consultation. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
<p>Dealing with a leaky faucet or sputtery garbage disposal is never enjoyable, but putting off fixing it for too long can cause water damage or increase your water expense.
