<p>When compared to gas models, electrical models are easier and less expensive to install as electricity is currently available through the main power supply line. For gas water heaters, a specific gas line needs to be set up and a feasible source of gas developed. Another function of an electrical water heater is that they do not require any ventilation. Gas designs need to be aerated properly utilizing vents and ducts in order to work correctly. With electric designs, you will not have to install any new vents or ducts in your home.</p>

After that the softener can be disconnected, transferred to its brand-new place and placed there.</p>
