<p>A testable backflow prevention device has two check valves-- generally 2 layers of protection. The device allows water to press the check valves open when water is entering into the building, but closes them shut when water tries to go the wrong way. There are two various kinds of testable backflow prevention devices that are typically specified-- a lowered pressure zone backflow device and a double check backflow device. There are a few others that I will mention but do not get hung up on them. I discuss them only because they will be on a certification test.</p>

When installing the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated effectively. It can also cause the system to leak if the bypass valve is split. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that may need to be re-lubricated or changed over time. A split rotor valve or rotor valve seal might also be the offender. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system during softening and regeneration procedures. A used water valve can secure and spring a leak. If the rotor valve's seal is leaking, it is likely broken and just requires to be replaced.</p>
