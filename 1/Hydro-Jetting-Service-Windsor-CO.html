<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on particular new sinks, but these will be labeled to that impact. If you can't utilize plumber's putty, utilize a non-water-based silicone. Excess putty will squeeze out in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in place. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to place the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another approach is to present a chemical substance that functions as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and remain suspended in the water rather than building up on surface areas. However, if they remain in one location for long, as they might in a water heater, the buildup might still occur.</p>
