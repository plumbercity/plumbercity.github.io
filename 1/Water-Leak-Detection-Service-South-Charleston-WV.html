<p>Sewer lines have one important role: carry wastewater out of a house or building. Although these homeowners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was definitely great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in good enough shape to reline before the issue became worse. Waiting simply wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a separated garage. At the least, it would have been a very expensive alternative.</p>
