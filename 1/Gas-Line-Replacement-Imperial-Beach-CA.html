<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends upon the extent of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

<p>A Water Softener is a filtration system that works to get rid of high concentrations of calcium and magnesium that cause difficult water. When water flows through a Water Softener, the system filters out these hard water minerals and the softened water then leaves the water softening system to stream through plumbing. State certified backflow specialists, readily available through your turf irrigation company or plumber can identify whether your equipment satisfies the requirements. The regulations also require a state certified backflow technician test the backflow preventer every year.</p>
