<p>Low Risks: For low hazards including fire systems and irrigation systems, City of Bellingham accepts check detector and double check valve assemblies, pressure vacuum breaker assemblies and atmospheric vacuum breakers as types of security. Since July 1, 1999, the DPH needs an RPD on all lines that result in a fire sprinkler system with siamese connections, except existing systems that already have a DCVA installed (Ct. Regs. § 19-13-38a( c)( I)).</p>

For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, since each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>

This piece of equipment is the center of controversy with lots of backflow authorities and ought to never be puzzled with Double Check Valves. Check with local authorities for needed installation, as the majority of do not acknowledge these as backflow prevention gadgets.</p>
