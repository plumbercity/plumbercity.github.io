<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these aspects are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>
