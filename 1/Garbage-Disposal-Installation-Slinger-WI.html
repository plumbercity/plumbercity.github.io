<p>Plumbers charge $75 to $150 to install a gas line sediment trap. Sediment traps capture wetness and sediment so that they do not get in the control unit. Unlike a drip leg, the circulation of the gas is become eliminate any sediment. A sediment trap might be included in a drip leg install.

<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years old and you need to work with a plumber for that burner set. The overall repair bill may be in the $300 variety. A gas hot water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair costs is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Choose the new heater.</p>
