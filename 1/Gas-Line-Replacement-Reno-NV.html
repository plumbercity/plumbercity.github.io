<p>The appropriate repair of a backflow preventer requires lots of items to be assessed. The hydraulic conditions present at the backflow prevention assembly need to be assessed. The installation needs to be examined to guarantee it does not circumvent the functions of the assembly. Test information should be accumulated to identify the functions of each component. The backflow prevention assembly must be dismantled and parts changed with initial factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly should be evaluated again to be sure it was correctly fixed. Comparing the test results from the repaired backflow prevention assembly to the manufacturers flow diagram is essential to guarantee it was repaired effectively. An appropriately repaired assembly must offer years of security.</p>
