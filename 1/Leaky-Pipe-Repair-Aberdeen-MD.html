The GFAVB is a non-testable system and are good for back siphonage just for non-health danger or health hazard conditions. They should be set up downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on a watering system you need to install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It must also be installed at least 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local officials, require that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet). Some municipalities do not permit the usage of GFAVB's. These systems will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can just secure versus back siphonage.</p>
