<p>When a big enough source of water has actually been recognized and evaluated, the 3rd major element of a supply of water system enters into play: a system of pipelines to communicate the water from its source to its customers. The largest of these primary long-distance transferring pipes are described as aqueducts. Normally constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) strengthened concrete pipe segments, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable covering, these are huge underground and aboveground pipes designed to carry bulk circulation quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and distribution nodes where the circulations are moved to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. Most large cities need numerous aqueducts supplying water from diverse and geographically separated sources.</p>
