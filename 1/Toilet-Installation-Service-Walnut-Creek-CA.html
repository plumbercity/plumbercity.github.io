<p>Lastly, the most complex and advanced backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 individually running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout standard water streams at design pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if pricey) device is best used in crucial areas where cross contamination could be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
