Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Usually, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in salt is small, however if you have actually been advised by a medical professional to follow a strict low salt diet plan this boost can posture problems.</p>

<p>Many homes or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather condition security. As the external coating of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
