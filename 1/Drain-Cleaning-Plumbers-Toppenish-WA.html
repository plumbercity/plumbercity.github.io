<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that permits water to go through it in one direction, but avoids it from going backwards in the opposite direction. You may be familiar with galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, put simply, the same thing, however without the zinc finish. The zinc covering on galvanized pipe for gas is meant to keep the pipe from corroding from contact with moisture. While it does its job quite well, in time, it still does rust. This permits the toilet to flush. A plumber will charge $135 to fix it.</p>
<p>Every toilet obstructions occasionally. How typically a toilet clogs depends upon the strength of its flush, the tidiness of its drain pipes, and what it's attempting to flush. If your toilet clogs more than as soon as a month-or even when a week!- it's probably because mineral deposits have actually developed around the top of the drain or in the drain pipes themselves.</p>

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return due to the fact that he had another consultation. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
