<p>Your home's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not really the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes.

When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there will not go through.</p>

I recently had several plumbing leaks fixed and could not be happier with the prompt service I got from Parker and Sons. They are very experienced, friendly, fairly priced, and do quality work. I would certainly suggest them to my household and everybody. I would trust them to repair any leak in your home.</p>
