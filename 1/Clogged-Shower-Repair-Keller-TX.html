<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these aspects are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
