<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection requests. No warm water in your house? Is your water taking too long to warm up? Is your hot water heater making sounds, or do you see rusty colored water in your home? If you have any of these issues, your water heater might need maintenance, repairs or perhaps a replacement. While some of these problems can be credited to regular wear and tear or improper installation, often your waste disposal unit ends up being damaged by items that shouldn't be run through it.</p>
<p>When a plumbing license has actually been issued in mistake due to the fact that of incorrect, insufficient or unreliable details, or the work for which the license was provided violates the Uniform Code, such authorization will be revoked or suspended up until such time as the permit holder shows that all work completed and all work proposed shall remain in compliance with suitable provisions of the code.</p>
