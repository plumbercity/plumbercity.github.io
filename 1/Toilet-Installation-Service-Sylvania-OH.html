<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
