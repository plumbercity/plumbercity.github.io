There are hydraulic conditions such as pressure fluctuations and disc compression that could cause false information on the operations of the backflow prevention assembly. Hydraulic conditions such as water hammer can lead to severe pressure spikes that might harm components. The impacts of raised temperature can also trigger extreme pressure conditions which could damage the parts in the components. These and other negative impacts from the hydraulic conditions need to be recognized and their cause remedied. The brand-new parts can quickly be made inoperative if parts are replaced and the hydraulic conditions are not corrected.</p>
