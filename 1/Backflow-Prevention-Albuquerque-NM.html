<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in Albuquerque NM 87121</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed price quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, because I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months back. I feel that rates were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list article from March said depending on the marketplace and severity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
