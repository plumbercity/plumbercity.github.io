Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Usually, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in salt is small, but if you've been recommended by a doctor to follow a stringent low salt diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
