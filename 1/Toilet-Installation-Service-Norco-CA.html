Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Usually, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions.
