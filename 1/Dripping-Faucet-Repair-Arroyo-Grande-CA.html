<p>Leakages are tricky. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capability to soften tough water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>Mounted under the sink, the garbage disposal is meant for slicing up small bits of waste food.
