<p>For more information on our Jonesboro drain services or to set up a visit, call us at (870) 300-2726. Stay away from strong chemicals: Commercial drain cleaners, bleach, and other strong chemicals need to never be used in your waste disposal unit. From above the sink, insert the flange into the drain hole and press down equally.

<p>When you have actually found the journey lever you desire, all you actually need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) remove your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your brand-new trip lever, location it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Bear in mind that due to the fact that of the way a lever works, the locknuts for most toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the proper method. When you have actually protected the journey lever and are all set to connect your flapper, make sure you have actually got simply enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
<p>The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, but it doesn't grind up food, this suggests the flywheel is stuck. Try freeing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom manage (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
