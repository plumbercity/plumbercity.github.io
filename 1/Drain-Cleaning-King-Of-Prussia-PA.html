<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building.
