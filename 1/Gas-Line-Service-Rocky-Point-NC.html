<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a variety of materials were used for home plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was utilized for sewer line piping. Although all these products are resilient in the short-term, they degrade over decades. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are susceptible to several kinds of rust. After about fifty years, they'll begin to compromise from rust and might place toxins into the freshwater supply. We suggest changing the steel, iron, and clay pipes in your home. This might not require totally repiping your home, given that more recent products may have already been used in some areas, such as the bathroom plumbing. A professional plumber can help you identify precisely what work needs to be done.</p>
<p>If your pipes are older than these standards, it doesn't always mean they need to be replaced. Properly maintained pipes might last longer, and badly preserved ones or those in areas with hard water (meaning it has high mineral material), might fail quicker, states Passaic, N.J., plumber Joseph Gove, who provided the life-span estimates.</p>
