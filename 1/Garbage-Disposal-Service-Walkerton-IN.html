<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Walkerton IN</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable television, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>

<h3>Unclog Drains, Toilets and Sewers With The Help of in Walkerton IN 46574 Plumbers</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed estimate to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, considering that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months ago. I feel that costs were increased since I had a "Offer". An Angie's list article from March said depending upon the market and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
