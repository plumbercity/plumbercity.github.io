<p>List prices for house water softeners may vary from around $400 to $2,700, depending upon the size and type of softener. Softeners are rated by the total variety of grains the system can get rid of before being recharged.

<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Usually, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in sodium is small, however if you've been advised by a medical professional to follow a strict low sodium diet this increase can posture problems.</p>
<p>Gas works in the house, but it also features workable threats. Regular gas line inspections can help to decrease the possibility of dangers in the home.
