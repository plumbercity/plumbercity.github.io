While some of these concerns can be attributed to normal wear and tear or improper installation, sometimes your waste disposal unit ends up being harmed by items that should not be run through it.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends on the level of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
