<p>The LAGBC is based on the 2013 California Green Structure Standards Code, typically referred to as "CALGreen" that was developed and mandated by the State to obtain consistency amongst the different jurisdictions within the State; lower the structure's energy and water usage; decrease waste; and reduce the carbon footprint. Continuous feed disposals are simple to operate: you run water in the kitchen sink, turn a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste.

<p>That said, you do not always need to drain 10s of thousands of dollars on repairing your home's pipe or sewer lines.

Water softener systems use resin beads that attract and attach salt ions in the softener tank. Pumps push hard water through the resin beads exchanging hardness ions with salt ions, softening the water.</p>
