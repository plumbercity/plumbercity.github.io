On average, the lifespan of most water heaters is in between ten and fifteen years. Of course, this lifespan varies according to the frequency of use and care and maintenance. Understanding when it's time for hot water heater repair enables you to make educated decisions and guarantee a constant supply of clean, safe hot water.</p>
<p>1. Flashes of cold water - If you're not getting hot water, your system clearly requires repairs. But even if you're often getting bouts of cold water throughout your hot shower then you need to hire our League City hot water heater repair experts. What's probably triggering this is a fracture in television that's responsible for generating cold water into your water heater leading to incoming cold water blending with your outgoing hot water.</p>
