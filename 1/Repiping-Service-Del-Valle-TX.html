Normally, minerals get there due to the fact that groundwater will liquify rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the residues take a trip with the water up until it remains in your house. Water softening uses an ion exchange process to remove liquified minerals that aren't as efficiently gotten rid of by mechanical filtration. These materials are what triggers difficult water.</p>
