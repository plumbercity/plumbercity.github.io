<p>Strange Sounds - If uncommon gurgling is originating from your drain, it probably requires a thorough cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it challenging for the water to travel through. The pipes frequently make strange gurgling sounds as water efforts to pass through a clogged pipe because of the tight space. This triggers the water to bubble, as only little pockets of air are available, resulting in the strange sounds originating from your sink.</p>
