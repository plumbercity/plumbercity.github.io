<p>Caution: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. Since the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however in many cases it need to be much less water.</p>
<p>Physical strength. Plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters must be able to raise and move heavy tools and products. Tip: Location a heavy item such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation.
