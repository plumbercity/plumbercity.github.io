<p>The basic work week for plumbers is 40 hours (8 hours a day, 5 days a week). Similar to numerous careers in building and construction, there are peak durations that will require you to work overtime. The number of additional hours you work each week depends on the construction sector and area you work in, and will differ from one job to the next. Gradually, the limescale accumulation caused by difficult water can cause costly plumbing repairs. A RainSoft water conditioner can help avoid early wear and tear on your toilet.</p>
