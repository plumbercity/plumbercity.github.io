<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from normal flow instructions within a piping system that is brought on by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of typical flow in a system triggered by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water supply piping). Back-siphonage can take place when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is reduced main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>No property owner wants to deal with inefficient plumbing, particularly when it can cost thousands in repairs. Your houses plumbing goes beyond just the pipes inside your house to the main sewer line that connects to them.

Harmed sewer lines can result in restrooms flooded with sewage, broken pipes, and costly repairs.</p>
<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most common. To get rid of the disposer, support it from listed below and turn the big, 3-tab installing ring at the top counterclockwise up until the unit falls away. Get rid of the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening the three bolts and prying off the maintaining ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
