<p>The issue of leak can be credited to any variety of elements which can range from the tank is old and worn, to over-pressurization, as well as poor maintenance. The water heater tank should have some room to represent the expansion that occurs when heating the water. The thermal expansion needs to leave, for this reason the need for an expansion tank to help regulate the pressure. If the tank is old and worn, the force exerted by the expansion happening when boiling the water triggers the tank to break and start leaking. The remedy for this is to replace the hot water heater unit.</p>

For that reason, all backflow prevention assemblies need to be checked regularly to guarantee that they are functioning effectively. Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies have to be tested with properly calibrated gauge devices.</p>
