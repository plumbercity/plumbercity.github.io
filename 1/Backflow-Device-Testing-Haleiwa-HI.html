<p>Leakages are sneaky. With time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften hard water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, providing the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
