Constant feed disposals are simple to operate: you run water in the kitchen sink, flip a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste.

<p>The labor expenses for disposal installation are mostly time related. If everything is prepared, in excellent condition, and the disposal is on hand and quickly put in, the plumber will likely only charge for an hour or more of time. If things need to be modified, changed, or relocated to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours needed and therefore the total costs. Most plumbers charge in between $45 and $65 per hour, with the majority of disposal setups running $50 per hour for 3 hours overall, making the labor costs approximately $150.</p>
