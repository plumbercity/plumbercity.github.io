Some elements may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is a really crucial part of the design of each part. If the component is not repaired properly, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than direct or stable) of the component, which might trigger the component to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
