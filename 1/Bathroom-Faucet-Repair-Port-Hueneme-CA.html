<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic rust Direct contact between different metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two various types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced since of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
