<p>This post intends to deal with the common misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes rust This is not the case: an effectively set up water softener does not make the treated water more corrosive. Here are a few confusing facts that frequently lead people to this erroneous conclusion. First, naturally soft water is usually destructive. Therefore, softened water must also be corrosive, ideal? This is a misconception since naturally soft water tends to be destructive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening causes neither of these conditions.</p>
