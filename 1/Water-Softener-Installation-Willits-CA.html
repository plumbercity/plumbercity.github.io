<p>The secret to the technology is having the ability to manage both the crystal development rate and their removal from our polymer beads, thus getting rid of solidity ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not need replacement chemicals or regrowth of active websites," stated Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief innovation officer.

However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a frequent event, but it does occur more often than you believe! Typically it takes place in the evening when you don't notice the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the water company needs to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or connect a new pipe. This makes construction projects easily the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical cause of backflow. Fire engine use big pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding areas.</p>
