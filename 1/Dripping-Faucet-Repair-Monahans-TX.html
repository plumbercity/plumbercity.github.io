<p>Physical strength. Plumbers, steamfitters, and pipefitters must be able to raise and move heavy tools and materials. Idea: Location a heavy item such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation. Loosen the clamp and get rid of the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal.
