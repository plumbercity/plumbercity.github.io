<p>Leaks - Next, leaks represent the most common cause for kitchen sink repair.

<p>Have used Plumb Crazy on 3 different events, the last including a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our house.

They, similar to each person we have actually come across with Plumb Crazy, were polite, prompt, and very experienced. I would advise Plumb Crazy to anybody needing either big or small task plumbing work.</p>
