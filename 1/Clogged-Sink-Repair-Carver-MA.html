Typically built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) enhanced concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable covering, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes developed to bring bulk circulation amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and circulation nodes where the circulations are transferred to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines.
