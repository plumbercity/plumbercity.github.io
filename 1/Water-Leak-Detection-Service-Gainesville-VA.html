<h3>Gainesville VA 20155 Experts In Unclogging Drains</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, considering that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months earlier. I feel that rates were increased because I had a "Deal". An Angie's list article from March stated depending upon the market and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
<p>From beneath the sink, position a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Secure the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring. Next, ensure the drain compression seal is seated appropriately in the drain locknut, then re-install and tighten the drain locknut. Lastly, turn on the water and test for leakages.</p>
<p>While a Do It Yourself toilet replacement is certainly possible, it's also easy to screw up. And when you mess up a toilet installation, you can wind up with huge problems: Leaks, messed up floorings, moisture in floor foundations and walls-- serious and pricey problems. Unless you're very skilled, it's best to trust a professional for changing a toilet.</p>
<p>Rooter service can be an essential item on your list of drain cleaning maintenance. Tree roots, construction particles, and corrosion can establish on your residential or commercial property risking the safety and performance of your drain and sewer lines. This circumstance is best left to a trustworthy rooter service company like Maitz House Services. Our rooter group uses sophisticated drain cleaning methods to clear the toughest sewer line and drain clogs from tree roots and other difficult to reach particles.</p>
