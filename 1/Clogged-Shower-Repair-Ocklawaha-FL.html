The hourly charge for a plumbing contractor is $72 to $82, which does not include parts or products. Rates depend upon the exact repair required, where you live, employing a plumber vs. working with a handyman, and whether you can DIY it.</p>
<p>To connect a power cord to the new unit, get rid of the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and join the colored wires found inside with their equivalents in the cable, using wire nuts. The green ground wire is looped under the green screw on the system. This can be done at any point prior to installation. Plumbing strategies are not needed for one- and two-family homes or townhouses, as defined in the California Residential Code, and their accessory structures.</p>
