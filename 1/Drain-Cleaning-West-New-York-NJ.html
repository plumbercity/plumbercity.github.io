<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must first think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these elements are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
