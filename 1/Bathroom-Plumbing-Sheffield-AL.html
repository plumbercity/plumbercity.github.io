The biggest of these primary long-distance transferring pipes are referred to as aqueducts. Usually built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable finish, these are big underground and aboveground pipes created to carry bulk circulation quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and distribution nodes where the circulations are transferred to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines.
