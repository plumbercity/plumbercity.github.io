<h3>Bathtub Faucet Repair Tips and Techniques in New Kensington PA 15068</h3>
<p>If you notice an odor or undesirable odor coming from your unit, which is not unusual, consider investing in a flange that can seal up and cover the top of the disposal, where nasty smells can escape. These flanges are extensively offered and easy to install, costing around $30 in your home improvement or hardware stores. Shut off the supply of water to your house at the main line. To avoid leaks from springing throughout the installation process, shut down the water supply to your home. Make sure your water heater's water system is shut off, as is the electrical energy going to the unit.</p>

<p>The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, however it doesn't grind up food, this suggests the flywheel is stuck. Try releasing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the appropriate size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
