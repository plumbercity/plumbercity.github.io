<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water system. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
