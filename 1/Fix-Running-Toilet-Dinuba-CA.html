<p>Please let EBMUD understand of any situation that might require a backflow device. Often conditions on residential or commercial properties change that may need a backflow device, such as dealing with a boiler with ingredients or installing a well with a pump. Sewer repairs are more than an inconvenience for your business, they can cause financial losses and in some circumstances can stop your business completely. For restaurants having a drain back up or a sewer line break can be catastrophic. Even in a small office the concerns brought on by even little drain problems can trigger major concerns.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal option is to have the defective pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an alternative to think about if you reside in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for lots of years, however steel eventually experiences rust and lacks the toughness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
