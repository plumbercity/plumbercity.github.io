According to Sankarasubramanian et al., The median per capita water utilize per day is greater in rural counties than city counties in all the climate areas, except in the Central and Southeast regions"1 with rural areas having less efficient water supply systems2 mainly due to the relative lack of financial resources to upgrade and maintain their systems.

<p>Discover if there are any lead pipes in the house. Residences that were constructed prior to 1986 often have lead or galvanized plumbing.

You might not desire to live in a home that has lead pipes if you have children.</p>
