To discover a suitable replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Shut off the water before eliminating the flapper.)

<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- corrosive.

Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this type of rust A softener is simply catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations while doing so (generally sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
