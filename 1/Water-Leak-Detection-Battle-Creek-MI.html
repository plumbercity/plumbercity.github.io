<h3>Top Rated Atlanta Plumber Battle Creek MI</h3>
<p>Rusty water: If you have rusty water coming out of your faucets, particularly if that water is hot, the within your system is probably rusty. If it only occurs with warm water, you will likely have to replace your hot water heater. If you're like most property owners, you probably don't know what kind of pipes you have. A plumber from 1st Choice Plumbing can inform you for sure, however in general, there are three main kinds of pipes that tend to have problems.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>

<p>Water that has actually been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this type of rust A softener is merely recording some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (generally salt or often potassium).</p>
