<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Lake View NY</h3>
<p>Bought middle ground stainless-steel blade model offered at Lowes. Got a small local plumber who overcharged me, I believe. $212 with tax for installation just, incl. brand-new $25 strainer for the sink. Approximate. 1 hour work for two guys.

<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have moderately hard water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
