If there is a leak, one thing to know about gas lines is they can be incredibly harmful.

<p>Last but not least, the most advanced and complex backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 independently running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout standard water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if costly) device is best utilized in vital areas where cross contamination could be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
