<p>Sewer lines have one important role: bring wastewater out of a house or structure. Although these house owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly good timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in good enough shape to reline before the issue worsened. Waiting just wasn't an option. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a separated garage. At the least, it would have been an extremely costly choice.</p>
<p>A second part of the Battelle Study compared cleaning agent dose, water hardness, and washing temperature level to see if firmness had an effect on cleaning agent savings. The study included tests that eliminated challenging soils, in addition to evaluating filming and identifying. Researchers found that softened water uses practically 30% less detergent, but cleans along with water at 10 gpg solidity level. When comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level, that detergent savings rises to nearly 70%.</p>
