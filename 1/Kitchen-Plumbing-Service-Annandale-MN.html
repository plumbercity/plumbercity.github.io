<h3>Necessity of Sewer Line Inspection in Annandale MN 55302 and Its Procedures</h3>
<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a brine tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, takes place. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the sodium, or salt, is saved and combined with water. If you prepare to drain  your automated dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1).
