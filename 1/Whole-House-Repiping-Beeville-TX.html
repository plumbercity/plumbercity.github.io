<h3>Emergency Plumbing Tips For Your Everyday Plumber Beeville TX</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Not all toilet problems require the assistance of a professional. Some small obstructions can be taken care of with a plunger and often, when the toilet will not stop running, it's a basic matter of changing the chain on the flapper valve inside the tank. However, specific issues do require a skilled plumber, and it is essential to know the distinction to prevent wasted aggravation, time, and cash.</p>
