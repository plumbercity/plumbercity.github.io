<p>It's important to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger a correctly working RPZ assembly to occasionally discharge small amounts of water.

Adequate drainage needs to likewise be supplied.</p>
