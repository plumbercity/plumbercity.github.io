<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when searching for a feasible solution, particularly when basic plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are numerous drawbacks to utilizing these hazardous items - not least of which is that they typically contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a blockage, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life.

<h3>Safe Alternatives In Fixing A Blocked Drain in Oak Ridge TN 37830</h3>
<p>Water that has actually been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this type of deterioration A softener is merely capturing some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations at the same time (normally sodium or often potassium).</p>

<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits collect, till they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits occur more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned if you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue prior to you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
