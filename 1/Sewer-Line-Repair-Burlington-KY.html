<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Burlington KY</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself job. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
