When heated up, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate settle out of suspension (precipitate) from the water and form a mineral deposit at the bottom of the warm water heater.

Scale deposits also accumulate to plug plumbing components and build up in other home appliances such as coffee pots and dishwashing machines, hence impacting their performance.</p>
