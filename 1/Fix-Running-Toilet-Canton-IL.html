<p>Responsive circulation technology works by continually bringing tanks off-line and on-line in reaction to the water demands of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow innovation, just one of the four tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. Nevertheless, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive design permits the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than traditional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
