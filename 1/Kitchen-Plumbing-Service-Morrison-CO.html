<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize as soon as backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>Though it's not always required, often the plumber might have to repair or update circuitry to power the brand-new garbage disposal. This normally costs an additional $50 to $100+. The pilot burner may need to be relit, the gas line might be clogged or need repair. If the gas line is damaged, the flowers or plant life near the gas leak will be discolored or deteriorated.
