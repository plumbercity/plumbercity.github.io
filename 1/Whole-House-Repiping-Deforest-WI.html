For example, cleaning fluids might be drawn back from car washes; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler may get in the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water supply from cooling cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray advancement might stream in reverse into the potable water system. To safeguard water quality, backflow security is needed where the end user positions a risk of contaminating the city's water system.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.
