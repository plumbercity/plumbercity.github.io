<h3>Three Ways To Find An Emergency Plumber Near Me Bay Saint Louis MS</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed problem. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Replacing your flapper might require a little different actions than we show (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, discovering a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job. To find an appropriate replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Turn off the water prior to getting rid of the flapper.) You might not find a similar match, but possibilities are you'll locate one of the very same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
