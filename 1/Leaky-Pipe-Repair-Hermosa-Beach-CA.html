Once again I have not seen electrical take any sort of precidence over plumbing. In reality, if not done it can be among the most expensive repair tasks if ignored. For example, if your water piping is galvanized pipe and pressure is an issue, you may need all of your water piping changed. Once again, very expensive. This is just one of numerous problems that can appear.</p>
