<p>Climatic Vacuum Breaker - Design GFAVB - The atmospheric vacuum breaker is among the least pricey backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable system and benefit back siphonage just for non-health hazard or health danger conditions. They should be installed downstream from any turned off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on a watering system you need to install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It must also be set up a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local officials, require that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the greatest outlet). Some towns do not enable the usage of GFAVB's. These units will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can just protect versus back siphonage.</p>
<p>Tip: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not prevent back-pressure.

They are extremely educated, friendly, reasonably priced, and do quality work. I would certainly suggest them to my family and everybody. I would trust them to repair any leak in your house.</p>
