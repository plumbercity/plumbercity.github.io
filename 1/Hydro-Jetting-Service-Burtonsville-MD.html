Our waste disposal unit repair service technicians can detect any problem that might arise with your system, and we can help you choose in between repair and replacement. If you wish to remain ahead of repairs, routine maintenance is a great method to do so.</p>
<p>Leaky faucets and clogged drains are the most common sink repair problems. Common enough that many people opt for do-it-yourself repairs. However in some cases even determining the leak can be a problem. It might be the shutoff valve, the faucet, a spray hose, waste disposal unit fittings, the edge of the sink itself, or any part of the drain-- tailpiece, extension tube, slip extension, elbows, T joints, or the U or J trap.</p>
