Because case, step from the downspout to the closest manhole, and use an auger line a minimum of that long to guarantee you're cleaning the entire pipe. A garbage disposal will last 10 to 12-years, and a lot of guarantees cover the first 2 to 5-years. When acquiring a brand-new system, keep this in mind.</p>
<p>You depend on your drains to bring wastewater from your sink, tub or shower. Gradually, the drains end up being clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These products collect in the drain and ultimately harden versus the pipe walls, making them hard to eliminate.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another consultation, they called him back and he said he would not come back.
