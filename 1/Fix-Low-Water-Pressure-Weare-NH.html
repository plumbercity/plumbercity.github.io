Make sure that the softener is correctly placed. The inlet needs to be connected to the water system and the outlet should be facing the direction of the warm water home appliances.</p>

Inspections must be made after foundation excavation (before pouring concrete), after rough-in (prior to concealing work), and upon completion. KEEP IN MIND: If malfunctioning work is discovered, the inspector will release an offense notification, and a specific period of time is allocated to fix the issue.</p>
