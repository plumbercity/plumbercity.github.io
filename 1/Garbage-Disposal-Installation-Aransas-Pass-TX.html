Due to the fact that of the tight space, the pipes often make weird gurgling noises as water efforts to go through a clogged pipe. This causes the water to bubble, as only small pockets of air are accessible, leading to the odd sounds originating from your sink.</p>
<p>Replacing your flapper might require somewhat various steps than we show (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube.

To find an appropriate replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Switch off the water before eliminating the flapper.) You might not discover a similar match, but possibilities are you'll find among the same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
