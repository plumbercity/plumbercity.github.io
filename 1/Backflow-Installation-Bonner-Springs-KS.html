<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet at Bonner Springs KS 66012</h3>
<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, happens. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the salt, or salt, is stored and combined with water. If you plan to drain  your automated dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate intact if you will not use your system to drain a dishwasher.</p>

<p>Polybutylene used inside your house can be discovered near the hot water heater or coming out of the walls to feed sinks or toilets. Warning: some plumbers set up stub outs" of copper when leaving the wall. Since copper is revealing does not imply you do not have polybutylene pipes, just.
