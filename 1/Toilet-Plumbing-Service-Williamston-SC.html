<p>When you count on Roto-Rooter for water heater replacement, repair or maintenance, you can anticipate professional service from experienced plumbing specialists. Backflow prevention devices run by allowing water to flow in only one direction. In a vulnerable water service connection, safe and clean water can flow both in and out of a building or fixture. When water service is disrupted in the street or in a structure for any reason, there is a pressure drop which can draw polluted water in reverse into the water system. For example, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from car washes; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler might go into the drinking waterline; bacteria and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water system from a/c cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray advancement might flow in reverse into the safe and clean water system. To secure water quality, backflow security is required where the end user postures a threat of polluting the city's water supply.</p>
