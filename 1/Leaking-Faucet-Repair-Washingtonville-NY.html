<p>The majority of demand for plumbers will originate from new building and the need to maintain and repair plumbing systems in existing homes and other structures. Employment of sprinklerfitters is expected to increase as states continue to adopt modifications to building codes that require using fire suppression systems.

If not-- or if there is no disposal currently in location-- start by getting rid of the old drain. Most drains are attached to the sink by a big nut below the sink that can be turned counter-clockwise to loosen up.</p>
