<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize once backwashing is total. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>

The majority of plumbers charge in between $45 and $65 per hour, with most disposal setups running $50 per hour for three hours total, making the labor expenses roughly $150.</p>
