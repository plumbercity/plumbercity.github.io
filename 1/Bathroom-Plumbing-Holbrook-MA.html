<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Holbrook MA</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed problem. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Inspect the disposal. Turn the power back on, run water into the sink and turn on the disposal to ensure it works. Inspect beneath to be sure there aren't any leaks. Run some food through the disposal to be sure it grinds and gets disposed of correctly. Pipes made of galvanized steel are no longer used in new houses, however lots of houses built in between the 1930s - 1980s still have them. Galvanized steel pipes need to be gotten rid of by a professional plumber when discovered and replaced with another pipe material.</p>
