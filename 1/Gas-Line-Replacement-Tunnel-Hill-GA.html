<p>Finally, the most complex and advanced backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five separately operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other four. During standard water flows at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if costly) device is best used in important areas where cross contamination might be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
