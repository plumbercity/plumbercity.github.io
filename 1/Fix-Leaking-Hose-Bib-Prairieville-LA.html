<h3>Shower Repairs in Prairieville LA 70769 - The Processes Involved</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed estimate to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, because I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months back. I feel that rates were increased due to the fact that I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March said depending upon the market and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
<p>Before installing, your professional will switch off water and electrical power to the area. Next, the old sink flange is gotten rid of and cleaned of any putty residue. Then, a new mounting ring is installed to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is linked, and the disposal is linked to its mount. In this approach, water is treated with a calculated amount of washing soda (Na2CO3) which transforms the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their respective carbonates which get precipitated.</p>
