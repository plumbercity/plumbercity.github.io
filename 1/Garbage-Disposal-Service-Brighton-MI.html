<p>Your sewer line is one of the most vital parts of your household plumbing - and if it becomes clogged or broken, it might wreak undesirable issues on your residential or commercial property. A house's service line (also referred to as a sewer lateral) ranges from the house to the mainline sewer in the street. For the most part, the property owner is responsible for maintaining the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is responsible for keeping the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>

We have the resources and experience to handle any task, little or large.

<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound potable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
