<h3>Hour Emergency Plumbing Service Independence KY</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable television, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup.

If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
