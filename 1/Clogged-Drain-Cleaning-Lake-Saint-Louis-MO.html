<p>The normal option is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is a choice to think about if you reside in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for lots of decades, but steel eventually experiences deterioration and does not have the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
