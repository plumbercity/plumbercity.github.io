This can happen in multiple locations and any combination of drains. For example, water may fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are several mixes of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and once you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from several drain lines in your home.</p>
