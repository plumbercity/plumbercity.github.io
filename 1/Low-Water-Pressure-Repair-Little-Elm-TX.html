<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and insured and fulfill our stiff trust certification requirements.

If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we recommend a brand-new faucet installation.</p>
<p>A continuous-feed waste disposal unit is the most common type which continues to run as long as the power switch is on. A continuous-feed disposal is best for combating large amounts of food waste. The majority of garbage disposals are plug-in, as it is more secure to have a vibrating system come unplugged then disconnected from fixed circuitry. However, some sinks do not have actually a plug-in installed below, and it may take an electrical expert and even allows to get one installed on its own dedicated circuit.</p>

<p>Warning: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on the majority of rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system. The possibility of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however for the most part it ought to be much less water.</p>
