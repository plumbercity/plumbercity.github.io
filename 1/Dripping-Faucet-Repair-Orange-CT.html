Often, a metal item, such as an utensil, staple, or coin , can jam a disposal.

<p>The brand-new inlets and outlets on the tank do not constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if required. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a brand-new ball valve while you're at it (Photo 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You might need to increase or decrease the vent size to guarantee the best draft. CARE: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>Our specialist plumbers will repair your toughest kitchen plumbing problems. Don't lose time and energy trying to repair your kitchen plumbing.

The lower ring flights up a set of ramps on the upper ring-pretty neat! But the last inch or two of rotation requires a reasonable quantity of force.</p>
