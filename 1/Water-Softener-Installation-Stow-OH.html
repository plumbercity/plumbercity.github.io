<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some elements may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An important thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the element. The guide is a really vital part of the design of each part. If the component is not fixed properly, the guide could restrict the movement (instead of direct or constant) of the component, which might trigger the part to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
