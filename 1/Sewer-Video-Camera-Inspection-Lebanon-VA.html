<p>In fact, reverse circulation testing designed to make sure that backflow preventers avoid backflow was eliminated from NFPA 25 in 2011. While NFPA recognizes that backflow stays a genuine health issue, it thinks about preventing it outside the scope of NFPA 25. Instead, NFPA presumes that local or state requirements will guarantee that backflow preventers are effectively tested by qualified personnel.</p>

<p>In the average repair, the old rubber parts must be gotten rid of and replaced with new rubber parts. When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is essential that just initial factory repair parts are used. The rubber parts the manufacturer produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was developed to use and altering the rubber from the original factory parts will impact the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
