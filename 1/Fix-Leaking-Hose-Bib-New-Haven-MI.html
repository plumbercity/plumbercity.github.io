<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service New Haven MI</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed issue. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Do you need a replacement for an older system that's become problematic, or just for a make over? How about for a structure addition or major remodel?

Installation involves over a dozen actions, and removing the old one involves even more operations. It can be hard matching up eliminate and fixture holes, and getting the new installation flat and level with everything sealed up.</p>
