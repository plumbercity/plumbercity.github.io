<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have moderately difficult water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
