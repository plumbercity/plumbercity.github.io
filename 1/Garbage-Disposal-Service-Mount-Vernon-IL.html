<p>Rust: The most typical problem is corrosion in the tank and pipes that link to your hot water heater. This is specifically true if you have unattended tough water, which consists of severe minerals that can connect to the piping and tank and break down the product gradually. Whether it's calcium, iron, or another aspect that is causing the deterioration, you will ultimately experience a leak in your hot water heater that is tough to repair. Leaks often mean a new system replacement is in order.</p>
<p>Tough water is triggered by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to get rid of these minerals.

Then they are replaced in the solution by the sodium ions.</p>
