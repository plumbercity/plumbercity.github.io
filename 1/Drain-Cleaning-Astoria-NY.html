<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is extensively thought of. If you have reasonably difficult water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams.

<h3>How to Fix a Leaky Faucet in the Kitchen in Astoria NY 11106</h3>
<p>A water softener has 2 tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the actual ion exchange, or water softening, occurs. It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the sodium, or salt, is stored and blended with water. If you prepare to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1).
