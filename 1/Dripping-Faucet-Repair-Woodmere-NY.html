<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
