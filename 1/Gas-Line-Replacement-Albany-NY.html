<p>Sewer lines have one vital function: bring wastewater out of a house or building. Although these homeowners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was definitely excellent timing to camera the line prior to collapsing.

At the least, it would have been a really costly alternative.</p>
<p>If you have a waste disposal unit, shut of the power to it at your main breaker panel prior to your start loosening up any pipes or supply lines. Whole-house repiping can certainly be a large undertaking, which is why the service is just carried out when absolutely needed. Initially, your plumber will decide which piping material to utilize for the job, either copper or plastic.

<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a flexible water system line. They're a lot much easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Be sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh.
