<p>Metal alloys are vulnerable to an electro-chemical condition called rust. Corrosion can literally consume a metal away triggering the metal to not be as strong as it originally was or change the tolerances causing parts to not work in a backflow preventer. If the part is functional or should be replaced, the result of rust on a metal alloy need to be evaluated to determine.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits accumulate, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits take place more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned if you want to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs, it's time for a new one.</p>
