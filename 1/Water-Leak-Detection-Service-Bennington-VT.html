Backflow prevention devices operate by permitting water to flow in only one direction. In an unprotected water service connection, drinkable water can stream both in and out of a building or component. When water service is interrupted in the street or in a building for any factor, there is a pressure drop which can draw contaminated water backwards into the water system. For example, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from car washes; stagnant water from fire sprinkler systems may enter the drinking waterline; bacteria and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water system from air conditioning cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray development might stream in reverse into the drinkable water supply. To safeguard water quality, backflow defense is needed where the end user poses a threat of polluting the city's water system.</p>
