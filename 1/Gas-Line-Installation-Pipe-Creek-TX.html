<p>Sinkholes do not just happen in your lawn, sadly, when a sewer line breaks. If there is a leak in a part of the sewer line running below your house's structure, the very best you can expect is to learn rapidly.

Often conditions on homes change that might require a backflow device, such as treating a boiler with additives or installing a well with a pump. Sewer repairs are more than a hassle for your organisation, they can cause monetary losses and in some circumstances can stop your company entirely.

An effective watering system keeps the water for landscapes separate from drinkable drinking water, avoiding contamination that can trigger health problems. That's why a backflow preventer is a requirement on any irrigation project.</p>
