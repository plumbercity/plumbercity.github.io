<p>Finally, the most complicated and sophisticated backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 separately running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other four. During basic water streams at design pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if pricey) device is best used in crucial locations where cross contamination could be a direct risk to life and health.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound safe and clean water supply. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building.
