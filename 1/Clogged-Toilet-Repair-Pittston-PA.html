<p>Responsive flow innovation works by continuously bringing tanks on-line and off-line in action to the water needs of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, just one of the 4 tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't busy.

This responsive style enables the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than conventional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
