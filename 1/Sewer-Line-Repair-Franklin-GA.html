<p>Water solidity is the quantity of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- tough water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The factor you can feel the difference on your skin is since soap responds with the calcium to form soap residue. This leads to the need for more soap or detergent to get things clean. Which's where the term solidity" came from ... it's tough to wash in.</p>
