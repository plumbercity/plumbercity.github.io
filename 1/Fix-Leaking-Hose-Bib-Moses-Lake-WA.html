<p>Water that has been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been gotten rid of-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this kind of deterioration A softener is simply recording some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (typically salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
