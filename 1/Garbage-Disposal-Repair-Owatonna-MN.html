<p>Instead of drudging big trenches to access your underground sewer system, Roto-Rooter technicians will drill just a few holes to see where the sewer line problem is and address it rapidly.

Nevertheless, there are lots of disadvantages to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they normally include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the danger of harm to your house and household.</p>
